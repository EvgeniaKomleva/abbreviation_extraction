Insight into Cisplatin-Resistance Signaling of W1 Ovarian Cancer Cells Emerges mTOR and HSP27 as Targets for Sensitization Strategies.	33287446	The microenvironment possesses a strong impact on the tumor chemoresistance when cells bind to components of the extracellular matrix. Here we elucidate the signaling pathways of cisplatin resistance in W1 ovarian cancer cells binding to collagen type 1 (COL1) and signaling interference with constitutive cisplatin resistance in W1CR cells to discover the targets for sensitization. Proteome kinase arrays and Western blots were used to identify the signaling components, their impact on cisplatin resistance was evaluated by inhibitory or knockdown approaches. W1 cell binding to COL1 upregulates integrin-associated signals via FAK/PRAS40/mTOR, confirmed by β1-integrin (ITGB1) knockdown. mTOR appears as key for resistance, its blockade reversed COL1 effects on W1 cell resistance completely. W1CR cells compensate ITGB1-knockdown by upregulation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) as alternative COL1 sensor. COL1 binding via DDR1 activates the MAPK pathway, of which JNK1/2 appears critical for COL1-mediated resistance. JNK1/2 inhibition inverts COL1 effects in W1CR cells, whereas intrinsic cisplatin resistance remained unaffected. Remarkably, knockdown of HSP27, another downstream MAPK pathway component overcomes intrinsic resistance completely sensitizing W1CR cells to the level of W1 cells for cisplatin cytotoxicity. Our data confirm the independent regulation of matrix-induced and intrinsic chemoresistance in W1 ovarian cancer cells and offer novel targets for sensitization.	DDR1	 discoidin domain receptor 1

Rye Snow Mold-Associated Microdochium nivale Strains Inhabiting a Common Area: Variability in Genetics, Morphotype, Extracellular Enzymatic Activities, and Virulence.	33287447	"Snow mold is a severe plant disease caused by psychrophilic or psychrotolerant fungi, of which Microdochium species are the most harmful. A clear understanding of Microdochium biology has many gaps; the pathocomplex and its dynamic are poorly characterized, virulence factors are unknown, genome sequences are not available, and the criteria of plant snow mold resistance are not elucidated. Our study aimed to identify comprehensive characteristics of a local community of snow mold-causing Microdochium species colonizing a particular crop culture. By using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique, we characterized fungal and bacterial communities of pink snow mold-affected winter rye (Secale cereale) plants within a given geographical location shortly after snowmelt. Twenty-one strains of M. nivale were isolated, classified on the basis of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, and characterized by morphology, synthesis of extracellular enzymes, and virulence. Several types of extracellular enzymatic activities, the level of which had no correlations with the degree of virulence, were revealed for Microdochium species for the first time. Our study shows that genetically and phenotypically diverse M. nivale strains simultaneously colonize winter rye plants within a common area, and each strain is likely to utilize its own, unique strategy to cause the disease using ""a personal"" pattern of extracellular enzymes."

Feeding Tall Fescue Seed Reduces Ewe Milk Production, Lamb Birth Weight and Pre-Weaning Growth Rate.	33287449	Endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) produces ergovaline and ergovalinine, which are mycotoxins that act as dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin and induce vasoconstriction. The experiment was designed as a 3 × 2 × 2 factorial with DRD2 genotype (AA, AG, GG), fescue seed (endophyte-free, E- or endophyte-infected, E+), stage of gestation (MID, d (day) 35-85; LATE, d 86-parturition) and all interactions in the model. Pregnant Suffolk ewes (n = 60) were stratified by genotype and fed E+ or E- seed in a total mixed ration according to treatment assignment. Serum prolactin concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) in ewes fed E+ seed but did not differ by maternal DRD2 genotype or two-way interaction. Lamb birth weight was lower (p < 0.05) in ewes fed E+ seed in last trimester. Pre-weaning growth rate, milk production and total weaning weight was reduced (p < 0.05) in ewes fed E+ fescue seed during MID and LATE gestation. Ingestion of ergovaline/ergovalinine in last trimester reduces lamb birth weight; however, lamb growth rate, milk production and total weaning weight are reduced in all ewes fed E+ during mid and last trimester.

Composites, Fabrication and Application of Polyvinylidene Fluoride for Flexible Electromechanical Devices: A Review.	33287450	The technological development of piezoelectric materials is crucial for developing wearable and flexible electromechanical devices. There are many inorganic materials with piezoelectric effects, such as piezoelectric ceramics, aluminum nitride and zinc oxide. They all have very high piezoelectric coefficients and large piezoelectric response ranges. The characteristics of high hardness and low tenacity make inorganic piezoelectric materials unsuitable for flexible devices that require frequent bending. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its derivatives are the most popular materials used in flexible electromechanical devices in recent years and have high flexibility, high sensitivity, high ductility and a certain piezoelectric coefficient. Owing to increasing the piezoelectric coefficient of PVDF, researchers are committed to optimizing PVDF materials and enhancing their polarity by a series of means to further improve their mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency. This paper reviews the latest PVDF-related optimization-based materials, related processing and polarization methods and the applications of these materials in, e.g., wearable functional devices, chemical sensors, biosensors and flexible actuator devices for flexible micro-electromechanical devices. We also discuss the challenges of wearable devices based on flexible piezoelectric polymer, considering where further practical applications could be.	PVDF	 Polyvinylidene fluoride
Comparison of Bisulfite Pyrosequencing and Methylation-Specific qPCR for Methylation Assessment.	33287451	Different methodological approaches are available to assess DNA methylation biomarkers. In this study, we evaluated two sodium bisulfite conversion-dependent methods, namely pyrosequencing and methylation-specific qPCR (MS-qPCR), with the aim of measuring the closeness of agreement of methylation values between these two methods and its effect when setting a cut-off. Methylation of tumor suppressor gene p16/INK4A was evaluated in 80 lung cancer patients from which cytological lymph node samples were obtained. Cluster analyses were used to establish methylated and unmethylated groups for each method. Agreement and concordance between pyrosequencing and MS-qPCR was evaluated with Pearson's correlation, Bland-Altman, Cohen's kappa index and ROC curve analyses. Based on these analyses, cut-offs were derived for MS-qPCR. An acceptable correlation (Pearson's R2 = 0.738) was found between pyrosequencing (PYRmean) and MS-qPCR (NMP; normalized methylation percentage), providing similar clinical results when categorizing data as binary using cluster analysis. Compared to pyrosequencing, MS-qPCR tended to underestimate methylation for values between 0 and 15%, while for methylation >30% overestimation was observed. The estimated cut-off for MS-qPCR data based on cluster analysis, kappa-index agreement and ROC curve analysis were much lower than that derived from pyrosequencing. In conclusion, our results indicate that independently of the approach used for estimating the cut-off, the methylation percentage obtained through MS-qPCR is lower than that calculated for pyrosequencing. These differences in data and therefore in the cut-off should be examined when using methylation biomarkers in the clinical practice.	MS-qPCR	 methylation-specific qPCR
The Role of Zinc and Copper in Gynecological Malignancies.	33287452	Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are essential microelements, which take part in cellular metabolism, feature in enzymatic systems, and regulate enzyme activity. Homeostasis of these micronutrients is tightly regulated by multiple compensatory mechanisms that balance their concentrations including transporters, importers, and metallothioneins. An altered intake of only one of these trace elements may cause an imbalance in their levels and result in their competition for absorption. Relatively low levels of zinc and increased levels of copper may result in an increased level of oxidative stress and impair the antioxidant properties of multiple enzymes. Altered levels of trace elements were discovered in various pathologies including immunological, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, due to the role of Zn and Cu in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, they were found to influence cancerogenesis. We review the roles of zinc and copper and their mechanisms in tumor growth, metastasis potential, microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance. We highlight their role as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, concentrating on their impact on gynecological malignancies.	ĠZn	 copper

Prolidase Stimulates Proliferation and Migration through Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway in Human Keratinocytes.	33287453	Recent reports have indicated prolidase (PEPD) as a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Since this receptor is involved in the promotion of cell proliferation, growth, and migration, we aimed to investigate whether prolidase may participate in wound healing in vitro. All experiments were performed in prolidase-treated human keratinocytes assessing cell vitality, proliferation, and migration. The expression of downstream signaling proteins induced by EGFR, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and β1-integrin receptors were evaluated by Western immunoblotting and immunocytochemical staining. To determine collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity radiometric and colorimetric methods were used, respectively. Proline content was determined by applying the liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. We found that prolidase promoted the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes through stimulation of EGFR-downstream signaling pathways in which the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis was involved. Moreover, PEPD upregulated the expression of β1-integrin and IGF-1 receptors and their downstream proteins. Proline concentration and collagen biosynthesis were increased in HaCaT cells under prolidase treatment. Since extracellular prolidase as a ligand of EGFR induced cell growth, migration, and collagen biosynthesis in keratinocytes, it may represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of skin wounds.

Biodegradable Hydrogels Loaded with Magnetically Responsive Microspheres as 2D and 3D Scaffolds.	33287454	Scaffolds play an essential role in the success of tissue engineering approaches. Their intrinsic properties are known to influence cellular processes such as adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Hydrogel-based matrices are attractive scaffolds due to their high-water content resembling the native extracellular matrix. In addition, polymer-based magnetoelectric materials have demonstrated suitable bioactivity, allowing to provide magnetically and mechanically activated biophysical electrical stimuli capable of improving cellular processes. The present work reports on a responsive scaffold based on poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microspheres and magnetic microsphere nanocomposites composed of PLLA and magnetostrictive cobalt ferrites (CoFe2O4), combined with a hydrogel matrix, which mimics the tissue's hydrated environment and acts as a support matrix. For cell proliferation evaluation, two different cell culture conditions (2D and 3D matrices) and two different strategies, static and dynamic culture, were applied in order to evaluate the influence of extracellular matrix-like confinement and the magnetoelectric/magneto-mechanical effect on cellular behavior. MC3T3-E1 proliferation rate is increased under dynamic conditions, indicating the potential use of hydrogel matrices with remotely stimulated magnetostrictive biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Combination with Chemotherapy as a First-Line Therapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Carcinoma.	33287455	Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) have a very short survival time even if they receive standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (EP). Several randomized controlled trials have shown that patients with ED-SCLC who received a combination of EP plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had superior survival compared with those who received EP alone. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to provide a ranking of ICIs for our primary endpoints in terms of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR), as well as our secondary endpoint in terms of adverse events. The fractional polynomial model was used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratios for the survival indicators (OS and PFS). Treatment rank was estimated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), as well as the probability of being best (Prbest) reference. EP plus nivolumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab had significant benefits compared with EP alone in terms of OS (Hazard Ratio HR = 0.67, 95% Confidence Interval CI = 0.46-0.98 for nivolumab, HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54-0.91 for atezolizumab, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59-0.90 for durvalumab) but no significant differences were observed for pembrolizumab or ipilimumab. The probability of nivolumab being ranked first among all treatment arms was highest (SCURA = 78.7%, Prbest = 46.7%).

In addition, nivolumab had the highest probability of grade 3-4 adverse events (SUCRA = 84.8%) in our study.

Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Combination with Chemotherapy as a First-Line Therapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Carcinoma.	33287455	Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) have a very short survival time even if they receive standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (EP). Several randomized controlled trials have shown that patients with ED-SCLC who received a combination of EP plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had superior survival compared with those who received EP alone. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to provide a ranking of ICIs for our primary endpoints in terms of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR), as well as our secondary endpoint in terms of adverse events. The fractional polynomial model was used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratios for the survival indicators (OS and PFS). Treatment rank was estimated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), as well as the probability of being best (Prbest) reference. EP plus nivolumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab had significant benefits compared with EP alone in terms of OS (Hazard Ratio HR = 0.67, 95% Confidence Interval CI = 0.46-0.98 for nivolumab, HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54-0.91 for atezolizumab, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59-0.90 for durvalumab) but no significant differences were observed for pembrolizumab or ipilimumab. The probability of nivolumab being ranked first among all treatment arms was highest (SCURA = 78.7%, Prbest = 46.7%). All EP plus ICI combinations had a longer PFS compared with EP alone (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.46-0.92 for nivolumab, HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.96 for atezolizumab, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65-0.94 for durvalumab, HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.61-0.92 for pembrolizumab), and nivolumab was ranked first in terms of PFS (SCURA = 85.0%, Prbest = 66.8%).

Selection by Lambs Grazing Plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), White Clover (Trifolium repens L.), Red Clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) across Seasons.	33287456	Plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) are now widely used in combination with clover species to provide greater annual lamb live weight gains than perennial ryegrass and white clover pasture. Reported selective grazing of the species in herb-clover mixes could potentially detrimentally change the relative abundance of species and decrease lamb production. Lambs were offered three herbage treatments: Pasture (perennial ryegrass and white clover) mix, plantain (plantain, red clover and white clover) mix and a chicory (chicory, plantain, red clover and white clover) mix in each of four seasons for two years. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replicates with 18-30 lambs per treatment replicate depending on the season. Lambs were rotationally grazed and fed ad libitum. Selection by the lambs of individually tagged plants within the pasture treatments was observed for three days on two occasions per season. Red clover was the most selected species on day 1, but by day 3 there was no difference in the selection of the species (p < 0.05). Plantain and chicory in the plantain and chicory mixes were selected less on day 1 in autumn relative to the other seasons (p < 0.05). It was concluded that three days of grazing before moving lambs maintained the relative abundance of species in the herb-clover mixes.	Ġherb-clover	 white clover

Disturbed Eating Behaviors in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes: An Exploratory Study about Challenges in Diagnosis.	33287458	"Disordered eating behaviors (DEBs), including diagnosable eating disorders, are quite common and can interfere with optimal type 1 diabetes (T1DM) management. We explored DEBs prevalence in youth with T1DM, proposing news diagnostic subscales, to represent the clinical dimensions associated with feeding and eating disorders (ED); Methods: additionally to SCOFF questionnaire and Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), four subscales combined from the original DEPS-R questionnaire were administered to 40 youths with T1DM (15.0 ± 2.6); Results: females showed higher scores than males in DEPS-R original factor 2 (""preoccupations with thinness/weight"", p = 0.024) and in DEPS-R proposed ""restriction"" factor (p = 0.009).

Development of Genotype-Specific Anti-Bovine Rotavirus A Immunoglobulin Yolk Based on a Current Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of Bovine Rotaviruses A Collected in Japan during 2017-2020.	33287460	Bovine rotavirus A (RVA), a major causative pathogen of diarrhea in dairy and Japanese beef calves, has led to severe economic losses in numerous countries. A dual genotyping system based on genomic segments encoding VP7 (G genotype) and VP4 (P genotype), comprising the outer layer of the virion, has been used to understand the epidemiological dynamics of RVAs at the national and global levels. This study aimed to investigate occurrence frequency of G and P genotypes for multiple bovine RVAs from calf diarrheic samples collected in Japan from 2017 to 2020. After we produced anti-bovine RVA immunoglobulin yolks (IgYs) from hens immunized with the two RVAs with different genotypes (G6P[5] and G10P[11]) selected on the basis of the current epidemiological survey, we investigated cross-reactivity against bovine RVAs with different G and P combinations owing to establish a useful strategy to protect calves from RVA infections using the two IgYs. Consequently, the two produced anti-bovine IgYs showed strong cross-reactivity against bovine RVAs with the same G and/or P genotypes in neutralization assay, respectively. Therefore, our data suggest the possibility of a passive immunization to protect calves from a bovine RVA infections epidemic in Japan via oral administration of the two IgYs into calves. The findings presented herein will provide important information that IgY is one of the effective tools to prevent infections of various pathogens.	RVA	 rotavirus A
Fatty-Acid-Binding Protein 4 as a Novel Contributor to Mononuclear Cell Activation and Endothelial Cell Dysfunction in Atherosclerosis.	33287461	Background-Elevated circulating fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) levels may be linked with cardiovascular events. This study aimed to investigate the mechanistic role of FABP4 in atherosclerosis. Methods-We recruited 22 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and 40 control subjects. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) and human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) were used for in vitro study. Results-Patients with CAD were predominantly male with an enhanced prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history. FABP4 concentrations were up-regulated in culture supernatants of MNCs from CAD patients, which were positively correlated with the patients' age, waist-hip ratio, body mass index, serum creatinine, type 2 diabetes, and the presence of hypertension. The adhesiveness of HCAECs to monocytic cells can be activated by FABP4, which was reversed by an FABP4 antibody. FABP4 blockade attenuated the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-selectin. FABP4 impaired the tube formation and migration via the ERK/JNK/STAT-1 signaling pathway. FABP4 suppressed phosphorylation of eNOS and expression of SDF-1 protein, both of which can be reversed by treatment with VEGF. Blockade of FABP4 also improved the oxLDL-impaired cell function. Conclusion-We discovered a novel pathogenic role of FABP4 in MNC activation and endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis. FABP4 may be a therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis.	oxLDL)-induced	 oxidized low-density lipoprotein

Assessment of Microvessel Permeability in Murine Atherosclerotic Vein Grafts Using Two-Photon Intravital Microscopy.	33287463	Plaque angiogenesis and plaque hemorrhage are major players in the destabilization and rupture of atherosclerotic lesions. As these are dynamic processes, imaging of plaque angiogenesis, especially the integrity or leakiness of angiogenic vessels, can be an extremely useful tool in the studies on atherosclerosis pathophysiology. Visualizing plaque microvessels in 3D would enable us to study the architecture and permeability of adventitial and intimal plaque microvessels in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. We hypothesized that a comparison of the vascular permeability between healthy continuous and fenestrated as well as diseased leaky microvessels, would allow us to evaluate plaque microvessel leakiness. We developed and validated a two photon intravital microscopy (2P-IVM) method to assess the leakiness of plaque microvessels in murine atherosclerosis-prone ApoE3*Leiden vein grafts based on the quantification of fluorescent-dextrans extravasation in real-time. We describe a novel 2P-IVM set up to study vessels in the neck region of living mice. We show that microvessels in vein graft lesions are in their pathological state more permeable in comparison with healthy continuous and fenestrated microvessels. This 2P-IVM method is a promising approach to assess plaque angiogenesis and leakiness. Moreover, this method is an important advancement to validate therapeutic angiogenic interventions in preclinical atherosclerosis models.	2P-IVM	 two photon intravital microscopy
Role of Cyclooxygenase-2 in Head and Neck Tumorigenesis.	33287464	The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a potent enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PG), including PGE2, a key mediator of inflammation and angiogenesis. Importantly, COX-2 is activated in response to inflammatory stimuli, where it is also believed to promote the development and progression of head and neck cancers (HNC). COX-2 can mediate its protumorigenic effect through various mechanisms, such as inducing cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and suppressing the host's immune response. Furthermore, COX-2 can induce the production of vascular endothelial growth factors, hence, promoting angiogenesis. Indeed, the ability of COX-2 inhibitors to selectively restrict the proliferation of tumor cells and mediating apoptosis provides promising therapeutic targets for cancer patients. Thus, in this comprehensive review, we summarized the reported differential expression patterns of COX-2 in different stages of head and neck carcinogenesis-from potentially premalignant lesions to invasive carcinomas. Furthermore, we examined the available meta-analysis evidence for COX-2 role in the carcinogenesis of HNC. Finally, further understanding of the biological processes of COX-2 and its role in orchestrating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis may give therapeutically beneficial insight to develop the management plan of HNC patients and improve their clinical outcomes.

Endoglin: An 'Accessory' Receptor Regulating Blood Cell Development and Inflammation.	33287465	Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic factor sensed by most cells. It regulates a broad spectrum of cellular responses including hematopoiesis. In order to process TGF-β1-responses in time and space in an appropriate manner, there is a tight regulation of its signaling at diverse steps. The downstream signaling is mediated by type I and type II receptors and modulated by the 'accessory' receptor Endoglin also termed cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105). Endoglin was initially identified on pre-B leukemia cells but has received most attention due to its high expression on activated endothelial cells. In turn, Endoglin has been figured out as the causative factor for diseases associated with vascular dysfunction like hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-1 (HHT-1), pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUPR). Because HHT patients often show signs of inflammation at vascular lesions, and loss of Endoglin in the myeloid lineage leads to spontaneous inflammation, it is speculated that Endoglin impacts inflammatory processes. In line, Endoglin is expressed on progenitor/precursor cells during hematopoiesis as well as on mature, differentiated cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, so far only pro-monocytes and macrophages have been in the focus of research, although Endoglin has been identified in many other immune system cell subsets. These findings imply a functional role of Endoglin in the maturation and function of immune cells. Aside the functional relevance of Endoglin in endothelial cells, CD105 is differentially expressed during hematopoiesis, arguing for a role of this receptor in the development of individual cell lineages. In addition, Endoglin expression is present on mature immune cells of the innate (i.e., macrophages and mast cells) and the adaptive (i.e., T-cells) immune system, further suggesting Endoglin as a factor that shapes immune responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on Endoglin expression and function in hematopoietic precursors and mature hematopoietic cells of different lineages.

In addition, Endoglin expression is present on mature immune cells of the innate (i.e., macrophages and mast cells) and the adaptive (i.e., T-cells) immune system, further suggesting Endoglin as a factor that shapes immune responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on Endoglin expression and function in hematopoietic precursors and mature hematopoietic cells of different lineages.

Phytochemical Profile and Antioxidant Activity of Aerial and Underground Parts of Salvia bulleyana Diels. Plants.	33287467	Plants have been used for medical purposes since ancient times. However, a detailed analysis of their biological properties and their associated active compounds is needed to justify their therapeutic use in modern medicine. The aim of the study was to identify and quantify the phenolics present in hydromethanolic extracts of the roots and shoots of the Chinese Salvia species, Salvia bulleyana. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) detection. The extracts of S. bulleyana were also screened for their antioxidant activity using ferric ion (Fe3+) reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), diammonium 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) cation (ABTS), superoxide radical anion (O2•-), and inhibition of lipid peroxidation assays. The S. bulleyana extracts were found to contain 38 substances, of which 36 were phenols, with a total level of 14.4&nbsp;mg/g DW (dry weight) in shoots, and 23.1 mg/g DW in roots. Twenty-eight phenols were polyphenolic acids or their derivatives, the most abundant in shoots being rosmarinic acid, and in roots, salvianolic acid K followed by rosmarinic acid. The other major phenolic acids were caffeic acid, caffeoyl-threonic acids, isomers of lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid F, salvianolic acid B, and yunnaneic acid E. In addition to polyphenolic acids, nine flavonoids were detected in the shoot extract. While both extracts showed significant antioxidant activity, the shoot extract, containing both polyphenolic acids and flavonoids, demonstrated a slightly greater antioxidant potential in some of the anti-radical tests than the roots. However, the root extract proved to be slightly more effective in the lipid peroxidation inhibition test. Thus, S. bulleyana was demonstrated as a promising source of antioxidants, and worthy of further more detailed studies.	ĠDW	dry weight

[Protective effects of taurine on neurons and microglia in Parkinson's disease-like mouse model induced by paraquat].	33287470	Objective: To investigate the protective effect of taurine (Tau) on hippocampus, substantia nigra neurons and microglia in paraquat (PQ) -induced Pakinson's disease-like mice. Methods: In April 2019, the specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice (n=36) were randomly divided into control group (NaCl) , Tau control group (150 mg/kg) , PQ exposure group (10 mg/kg PQ group, 15 mg/kg PQ group) , Tau intervention group (Tau+10 mg/kg PQ group, Tau+15 mg/kg PQ group) , respectively. Tau was used in 1 h before PQ administration for consecutive 6 weeks (twice per week) . General and neurobehavioral tests (Traction test, Open field test, Forced Swimming test, Tail suspension test, High plus maze and Object recognition test) were performed to test motor and cognitive function. After neuroethology detection, mice were euthanized and brains were collected. Nissl staining was used to detect the changes of the number and morphology of Nissl bodies in hippocampus and substantia nigra neurons of mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to test the levels of neuron marker neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN) , substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) , α-synuclein (α-syn) , microglia markers ionized calcium bindingadaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) , inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in mice substantia nigra. The coexpression of Iba-1 and TH double-labeling, α-syn and TH double-labeling in mice substantia nigra were measured by immunofluorescence double staining. Results: General behavioral changes such as slow reaction and reduced action occurred in mice of PQ group. Compared with the control group, the scores of Traction test, and the time ratio of new object recognition in the PQ group decreased (P<0.05) , the fixed time of Swimming test and Tail suspension test increased (P<0.05) , the horizontal crawl number and vertical times of Open field test and the ratio of open arm residence time of High plus maze in the 15 mg/kg PQ group decreased (P<0.05) . Compared with the PQ group, the same dose of Tau+PQ group showed increased scores in Traction test (P<0.05) and decreased fixed time of Swimming test and Tail suspension test (P<0.05) . Compared with the 15 mg/kg PQ group, the horizontal crawl number of Open field test and the time ratio of new object recognition increased in the Tau+15 mg/kg PQ group (P<0.05) . Compared with the control group, the PQ group showed a decrease in the number of Nissl body in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (P<0.05) , a decrease in the number of NeuN and TH positive cells in the substantia nigra (P<0.05) , with a large number of α-syn deposition, Iba-1 activation of microglia cells, and an increase in the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, iNOS) in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (P<0.05) . Compared with the PQ group, the same dose of Tau+PQ group showed the number of Nissl in the hippocampus and substantia nigra was significantly increased (P<0.05) , the number of NeuN and TH positive cells in the substantia nigra was significantly increased (P<0.05) , the expression levels of α-syn, Iba-1 and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, iNOS) in the substantia nigra were significantly decreased (P<0.05) . Conclusion: Tau could protect PQ-induced degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and hippocampal neuron loss by inhibiting the activation of microglia cells and release of inflammatory factors, and effectively improve the neurobehavioral and brain histopathological changes of PQ-induced PD-like mice.

Methods: In April 2019, the specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice (n=36) were randomly divided into control group (NaCl) , Tau control group (150 mg/kg) , PQ exposure group (10 mg/kg PQ group, 15 mg/kg PQ group) , Tau intervention group (Tau+10 mg/kg PQ group, Tau+15 mg/kg PQ group) , respectively. Tau was used in 1 h before PQ administration for consecutive 6 weeks (twice per week) . General and neurobehavioral tests (Traction test, Open field test, Forced Swimming test, Tail suspension test, High plus maze and Object recognition test) were performed to test motor and cognitive function. After neuroethology detection, mice were euthanized and brains were collected. Nissl staining was used to detect the changes of the number and morphology of Nissl bodies in hippocampus and substantia nigra neurons of mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to test the levels of neuron marker neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN) , substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) , α-synuclein (α-syn) , microglia markers ionized calcium bindingadaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) , inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in mice substantia nigra. The coexpression of Iba-1 and TH double-labeling, α-syn and TH double-labeling in mice substantia nigra were measured by immunofluorescence double staining. Results: General behavioral changes such as slow reaction and reduced action occurred in mice of PQ group. Compared with the control group, the scores of Traction test, and the time ratio of new object recognition in the PQ group decreased (P<0.05) , the fixed time of Swimming test and Tail suspension test increased (P<0.05) , the horizontal crawl number and vertical times of Open field test and the ratio of open arm residence time of High plus maze in the 15 mg/kg PQ group decreased (P<0.05) . Compared with the PQ group, the same dose of Tau+PQ group showed increased scores in Traction test (P<0.05) and decreased fixed time of Swimming test and Tail suspension test (P<0.05) . Compared with the 15 mg/kg PQ group, the horizontal crawl number of Open field test and the time ratio of new object recognition increased in the Tau+15 mg/kg PQ group (P<0.05) . Compared with the control group, the PQ group showed a decrease in the number of Nissl body in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (P<0.05) , a decrease in the number of NeuN and TH positive cells in the substantia nigra (P<0.05) , with a large number of α-syn deposition, Iba-1 activation of microglia cells, and an increase in the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, iNOS) in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (P<0.05) . Compared with the PQ group, the same dose of Tau+PQ group showed the number of Nissl in the hippocampus and substantia nigra was significantly increased (P<0.05) , the number of NeuN and TH positive cells in the substantia nigra was significantly increased (P<0.05) , the expression levels of α-syn, Iba-1 and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, iNOS) in the substantia nigra were significantly decreased (P<0.05) . Conclusion: Tau could protect PQ-induced degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and hippocampal neuron loss by inhibiting the activation of microglia cells and release of inflammatory factors, and effectively improve the neurobehavioral and brain histopathological changes of PQ-induced PD-like mice.

[Expression of CYP2E1 in different brain regions during the formation of toxic cerebral edema induced by 1, 2-DCE in mice and its effect on cerebral edema formation].	33287471	Objective: To study the expression changes of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in different brain regions during 1, 2-dichloroethane (1, 2-DCE) exposure, and to explore the effect of CYP2E1 on the influence and effect of brain edema caused by 1, 2-DCE poisoning. Methods: In December 2018, forty female SPF Kunming mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, 1 d, 2 d, and 3 d exposure groups, with 10 mice in each group. Placed in a 100 L static poisoning cabinet (5 animals/cabinet) , inhaled and exposed to the poison at 1.2 mg/L 1, 2-DCE for 3.5 h per day for 1 d, 2 d and 3 d. Except for exposure to 1, 2-DCE, other treatment methods were the same as those in the exposure groups. They were put to death the next day after the end of the poisoning, and the brain tissue was quickly removed and divided into sections. HE staining method was used for different brain regions. Western blotting method was used to detect the protein content of CYP2E1, occludin and claudin5 in different brain regions, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR method was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of CYP2E1, occludin and claudin5. Histopathological observations were performed, and the kit method was used to detect malondialdehyde (MDA) , reduced glutathione (GSH) content and catalase (CAT) activity in different brain regions. The experimental data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used for the comparison of multiple groups, and the SNK (q test) method was used for the pairwise comparison between groups.P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Compared with the control group, histopathological observations showed obvious brain edema in the 2 d and 3 d exposure groups; Compared with the control group, the MDA content, CYP2E1 protein and mRNA expression levels in the cerebellar tissues of the mice in the 3 d exposure group were significantly increased, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05) ; Compared with the control group, the GSH content, CAT activity, occludin and claudin5 protein expression levels in the cerebellar tissues of the mice in each exposure group were significantly reduced, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05) . There was no significant difference in the above indicators of frontal cortex in each group in mice (P>0.05) . Conclusion: 1, 2-DCE can induce the expression of CYP2E1 in cerebellar tissues of mice, and cause oxidative damage and brain edema, but has no effect on the expression of CYP2E1 in frontal cortex of mice.

[Mechanism of nano-indium-tin oxide inducing pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in Sprague-Dawley rats].	33287472	Objective: To investigate the pathogenesis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in rats induced by nano-indium-tin oxide exposure, and to provide a basis for further determining the limit of occupational exposure to indium and developing related protection measures. Methods: In August 2018, a total of 40 specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats, with an age of 6-8 weeks and a body weight of (200±10) g, were randomly divided into control group, low-dose group (1.2 mg/kg) , middle-dose group (3 mg/kg) , and high-dose group (6 mg/kg) , with 10 rats in each group. After 1 week of routine feeding, the rats were given non-exposed intratracheal instillation twice every week, with an interval of 3 days, for 12 consecutive weeks. Body weight was measured every week during exposure to observe the change in body weight; The rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by chloral hydrate after the exposure ended, and lung tissue and serum were collected; Hematoxylin-eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were performed for lung tissue to observe pathological results; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to measure the serum level of indium; ELISA was used to measure the levels of surfactant protein A (SP-A) , surfactant protein D (SP-D) , and the type II alveolar cell surface antigen Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) in lung tissue and the serum level of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) . Results: The pathological results showed that the rats in the control group had basically complete alveolar structure, and after intratracheal instillation of nano indium-tin oxide, uniform, eosinophilic, and unstructured granular substances were observed in the alveolar space of the low-, middle-, and high-dose exposure groups, with macrophage proliferation and an increase in macrophages, especially in the high-dose group. Negative PAS staining was observed in the control group, while substances with positive PAS staining were observed in lung tissue in each exposure group. The three exposure groups had a significantly higher serum level of indium than the control group (P<0.05) . Compared with the control group, the three exposure groups had significant increases in SP-A, SP-D, and KL-6 in lung tissue and a significant reduction in GM-CSF in serum (P<0.05) . Conclusion: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in rats may be associated with the destruction of alveolar macrophages caused by nano-indium-tin oxide and the aggregation of pulmonary surfactants due to disorders in the metabolism and clearance of pulmonary surfactants by macrophages.

Compared with the radiation workers in the age <30 years group (93.74%) , the 5-year normal rate of lens in the age ≥50 years group (72.51%) was lower (P<0.01) ; Compared with the radiation workers in the exposure age <10 years group (92.69%) , the 5-year normal rate of lens in more than 20 years exposed group (83.05%) was lower (P<0.01) . Multifactor analysis showed that age was an independent influencing factor for lens opacity in medical radiation workers (HR=14.485, P<0.01) . The risk of lens opacification increased by 4.9%, 10.1% and 15.5% in 30-, 40- and 50-years group, respectively. Gender, cigarette, alchol, type of work, length of service and annual effective dose had no significant effect on lens opacity (P>0.05) . Conclusion: Age is the main influencing factor of lens opacification in medical radiation workers, their radiation working time and intensity should be strictly controlled and radiation protection should be done.

[Research progress of occupational disease assessment and application on burden of disease].	33287491	Burden of disease (BOD) refers to the pressure on the entire social economy and health caused by disease, disability and premature death, and the resulting economic and social impacts. It includes epidemiological burden and economic burden. BOD is widely used in the analysis and research of various chronic diseases, infectious diseases and cancers. With the rapid development of economy and industrialization, the health effects of occupational diseases on workers and the resulting disease burden have become a major public health and social problem, which has caused widespread concern. However, in the field of occupational disease burden research, domestic and foreign scholars have little research on it, and lack of systematic research and framework construction. Therefore, this paper is intended to summarize the occupational disease assessment and applied research of BOD, in order to provide data support for occupational disease monitoring, health promotion and optimal allocation of health resources, and to provide theoretical basis and reference basis for the reform of occupational health work and the formulation of health policies.

[Old Country in New Fate-Feng Youlan's viewpoints on traditional Chinese Medicine].	33287492	"""Old Home land"" is an obvious symbolism of traditional Chinese medicine. It has different features with modern medicine. In this new era, how to keep the TCM ""new life"" , how to preserve and develop it, has become an important subject. Feng Youlan is an important scholar in modern Chinese academic society. His idea on Chinese society is extensive and profound. According to Feng Youlan, we should understand the Chinese medicine from its attributes in philosophy, science and culture. And the medicine and pharmacy in the Chinese medicine need to be discussed from different point views. On the other hand, the dispute between Chinese and Western medicine itself maybe lead to a false direction. By his personal experience, Feng suggested that the traditional Chinese medicine should not lose its characters in the future time of modernization."	ĠTCM	 traditional Chinese medicine
[Looking for the roots of Wa Na Qi].	33287493	Wa Na Qi(), is a traditional-curing male impotence medicinal. We have made several conclusions through a field investigation to Antarctica, material medica literature research, and current market investigation. Throughout history, Wa Na Qi (also known ashaigou shen) was a word of vague connotation which was not the meaning of a specific product. However, the most common meaning of Wa Na Qi was the penises of several different species of seals. The name Wa Na Qi was adapted from a foreign word, and it is believed to sound like walrus, which has also been credited as a source for Wa Na Qi. In Chinese, Wa Na was a reference to the roundness of the walrus but eventually became a general description of heaviness. Later, it became a name for fur seals. The Song Dynasty Materia Medica Bencao Tujing(, Illustration of Materia Medica) and the Ming Dynasty Materia Medica Bencao Pinhui Jingyao(, Collected Essentials of Species of Materia Medica) both had animal illustrations resembling fur seals. The illustrations in the Compendium of Materia Medica, or Bencao Gangmu, Jinling edition also had characteristics of a fur seal. However, in the Buyi Leigong Paozhi Bianlan(, Lei Gong's Guide to Drug Preparation with Addenda) and later materia medica works, the animal illustrations became distorted and almost myth-like. After a field investigation in Antarctica, we learned that historically, name Wa Na Qi probably originated from seals, such as fur seals. This information matches the current medicines available on the market.	ĠWa	 shen

[Clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of eosionphilic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma].	33287507	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of eosionphilic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (eChRCC), and differences in morphology, immunophenotype and clinical prognosis betweeneChRCC, renal oncocytoma(RO) and classic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (cChRCC). Methods: The clinicopathologic data of 17 patients diagnosed as eChRCC from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (13 cases) and 971 Hospital of PLA Navy (4 cases) from October 2006 to February 2019 were collected. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to compare the immunophenotypes between 17 cases with ChRCC, 27 cases with RO and 30 cases with cChRCC. Resuls: Among the 17 patients, seven were males and ten were females, and the age ranged from 40 to 75 years (median 54 years). Clinically, 15 cases of 17 were found accidentally by physical examination. The tumor size ranged from 1.8 cm to 10.0 cm (average 5.7 cm) and the cut surface of 15 cases were solid, one case was solicl and cystic, and one was cystic. Most showed gray to red, and partially soft, gray to yellow appearances. Microscopically, most tumors presented solid growth pattern with vary number of alveolar structures (12 cases). Some were predominately characterized by cystic structure (3 cases), alveolar structure(1 case) and microcapsule structure (1 case). There were boundaries with varying degrees of clarity between tumor cells in 16 cases. The cytoplasm of tumor cells was eosinophilic and the nuclei were small round or irregular with focal perinuclear haloes in 14 cases. Large polygonal cells with light-stained cytoplasm appeared focally in 9 cases, and edematous areas with scarce tumor cells were found in 4 cases. Among 7 cases, 4 cases focally invaded peripheral renal parenchyma, 2 cases invaded adipose tissues outside the renal capsule, and 1 case presented invasion of renal sinus. Immunohistochemically, all cases were moderate to strong positive for EMA and claudin-7. CK7, CD117 and Ksp-cad were highly expressed with the expression rates of 12/17, 15/17, 14/17, respectively. Cyclin D1, AMACR, CD10, S100A1, and RCC were rarely expressed with the expression rates of 4/17, 3/17, 4/17, 1/17 and 1/17, respectively. On the contrary, all cases were negative for vimentin, CAⅨ, HMB45 and Melan A. The Ki-67 proliferation index of the 17 cases was 1%‒5%. Follow-up data were available for all 17 patients from 7 to 154 months. Among them, 15 patients were alive without tumor recurrence or metastasis, one patient died of pulmonary metastasis after 31 months of surgery and one patient died of hepatic metastasis after 38 months of surgery. Conclusion: eChRCC has overlapping morphology and immunophenotype with RO. eChRCC is characterized by solid nest or alveolar structure, distinct border between tumor cells, perinuclear halos and lacking of interstitial looseness and edema. Scattered large polygonal cells with light-stained cytoplasm in tumor tissue play a significant role in the diagnosis of eChRCC. The positive expression of CK7, CD117, claudin-7 and Ksp-cad, and negative expression of cyclin D1, S100A1 are helpful to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of eChRCC. The prognosis of eChRCC after complete surgical resection is excellent and few cases may have long-term metastasis. There is no significant difference in prognosis between eChRCC and cChRCC, but eChRCC shows better outcome than RO.	cChRCC	 classic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
[Clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of eosionphilic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma].	33287507	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of eosionphilic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (eChRCC), and differences in morphology, immunophenotype and clinical prognosis betweeneChRCC, renal oncocytoma(RO) and classic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (cChRCC). Methods: The clinicopathologic data of 17 patients diagnosed as eChRCC from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (13 cases) and 971 Hospital of PLA Navy (4 cases) from October 2006 to February 2019 were collected. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to compare the immunophenotypes between 17 cases with ChRCC, 27 cases with RO and 30 cases with cChRCC. Resuls: Among the 17 patients, seven were males and ten were females, and the age ranged from 40 to 75 years (median 54 years). Clinically, 15 cases of 17 were found accidentally by physical examination. The tumor size ranged from 1.8 cm to 10.0 cm (average 5.7 cm) and the cut surface of 15 cases were solid, one case was solicl and cystic, and one was cystic. Most showed gray to red, and partially soft, gray to yellow appearances. Microscopically, most tumors presented solid growth pattern with vary number of alveolar structures (12 cases). Some were predominately characterized by cystic structure (3 cases), alveolar structure(1 case) and microcapsule structure (1 case). There were boundaries with varying degrees of clarity between tumor cells in 16 cases. The cytoplasm of tumor cells was eosinophilic and the nuclei were small round or irregular with focal perinuclear haloes in 14 cases. Large polygonal cells with light-stained cytoplasm appeared focally in 9 cases, and edematous areas with scarce tumor cells were found in 4 cases. Among 7 cases, 4 cases focally invaded peripheral renal parenchyma, 2 cases invaded adipose tissues outside the renal capsule, and 1 case presented invasion of renal sinus. Immunohistochemically, all cases were moderate to strong positive for EMA and claudin-7. CK7, CD117 and Ksp-cad were highly expressed with the expression rates of 12/17, 15/17, 14/17, respectively. Cyclin D1, AMACR, CD10, S100A1, and RCC were rarely expressed with the expression rates of 4/17, 3/17, 4/17, 1/17 and 1/17, respectively. On the contrary, all cases were negative for vimentin, CAⅨ, HMB45 and Melan A. The Ki-67 proliferation index of the 17 cases was 1%‒5%. Follow-up data were available for all 17 patients from 7 to 154 months. Among them, 15 patients were alive without tumor recurrence or metastasis, one patient died of pulmonary metastasis after 31 months of surgery and one patient died of hepatic metastasis after 38 months of surgery. Conclusion: eChRCC has overlapping morphology and immunophenotype with RO. eChRCC is characterized by solid nest or alveolar structure, distinct border between tumor cells, perinuclear halos and lacking of interstitial looseness and edema. Scattered large polygonal cells with light-stained cytoplasm in tumor tissue play a significant role in the diagnosis of eChRCC. The positive expression of CK7, CD117, claudin-7 and Ksp-cad, and negative expression of cyclin D1, S100A1 are helpful to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of eChRCC. The prognosis of eChRCC after complete surgical resection is excellent and few cases may have long-term metastasis. There is no significant difference in prognosis between eChRCC and cChRCC, but eChRCC shows better outcome than RO.	eChRCC	 eosionphilic Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
[Atypical renal cysts: a clinicopathological and molecular analysis of six cases].	33287508	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and molecular genetics of atypical renal cysts. Methods: Six cases of atypical renal cysts were collected from Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China, between February 2014 and February 2019. The clinicopathological characteristics and disease progression were analyzed. The 3p deletion and trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 17 were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: All of the 6 patients were male, aged 43-63 years (median: 52 years). Preoperative Bosniak classification showed 4 cases of grade Ⅱ, 1 case of grade Ⅰ and 1 of grade Ⅲ. Histologically, atypical renal cysts appeared as unilocular or multilocular cysts, lined by multilayered flattened or cuboidal-shaped clear or eosinophilic cells. They often showed short papillary projections, and lacked solid or nodular growth of the lesional cells within the wall or septa of the cysts. Histologically, these cysts could be classified into three categories: acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (ACKD-RCC)-like (3 cases), clear cell type (2 cases), and eosinophilic papillary type (1 case). Two cases of ACKD-RCC-like atypical renal cysts were accompanied by clear cell renal cell carcinomas. On immunohistochemical staining, ACKD-RCC-like atypical renal cysts were focally CK7+/AMACR+/CD57+, the clear-cell type atypical renal cysts were CK7+/CAⅨ+, and eosinophilic papillary type atypical renal cysts were CK7+/AMACR+. FISH analyses showed that one case of ACKD-RCC-like atypical renal cysts had trisomy 17 and one case of clear cell type had 3p deletion, while no signal abnormality was detected in the other cases. The six patients were followed up for 13 to 70 months (median: 27 months), and no evidence of renal cell carcinoma was noted. Conclusion: Atypical renal cysts are a group of lesions that are heterogeneous in clinical, histological and immunophenotypical and molecular genetic features. FISH analyses suggest that a subset of the cases may be precursors of currently known renal cell carcinomas. Extensively sampling and careful observation of the histological characteristics of the cyst wall are important for distinguishing atypical renal cysts from extensively cystic renal cell carcinomas.

[Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a clinicopathological analysis of 196 cases].	33287509	Objective: To analyze the clinico pathological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinomas. Methods: The clinical data, histology, immunophenotype and follow-up data of 196 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma diagnosed from 1994 to 2017 at the Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Military Medical University, Shanghai, China were analyzed retrospectively. Results: There were 142 males and 54 females, with a median age of 61 years. The top three metastatic sites for the 196 cases of metastatic renal cell carcinoma were lung (31.1%, 61/196), bone (29.1%, 57/196) and digestive system (19.4%, 38/196). Among the pathological subtypes of metastasis, the proportion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma was 94.4% (185/196) and that of type II papillary renal cell carcinoma was 3.6% (7/196). The TFE3 translocated renal cell carcinoma and congestive tubular carcinoma were rare, with 3 cases and 1 case, respectively. CK, vimentin, CAⅨ and CD10 were expressed in all metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas. CK7, CD10 and P504s were expressed in papillary renal cell carcinomas. TFE3 was expressed in TFE3 translocated renal cell carcinoma. The collecting duct carcinoma was positive for HCK. Conclusions: Lung metastasis and bone metastasis are still the most frequent metastatic sites of renal cell carcinoma. Five years after primary lesion resection may be the high risk time for metastasis. Most of the metastases are solitary when they are first identified. To better diagnose and identify the renal origin of a metastatic renal cell carcinoma, one should consider morphological characteristics, clinical history information of the metastasis and the combined immunohistochemistry of CK, vimentin, CD10, CK7, TFE3, PAX2 and PAX8.

[Clinicopathological and molecular features of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma].	33287510	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, immunophenotype, molecular genetics and differential diagnosis of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma (BSNS), and to evaluate the role of PAX3 and PAX8 immunohistochemical (IHC) antibodies in the diagnosis of BSNS. Methods: Nasal sinus spindle cell tumors surgically treated at the Jinling Hospital from 2000 to 2019 were collected, including three cases of BSNS, 10 cases of acinar rhabdomyosarcoma, eight cases of schwannoma, five cases of hemangiopericytoma, three cases of fibrosarcoma, and one case of triton tumor. The cases were evaluated by histology, IHC by EnVision for PAX3 and PAX 8 (including PAX8 murine monoclonal antibody, clone number OTI6H8, hereinafter referred to as PAX8-OTI6H8 antibody; PAX8 rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone number EP298, hereinafter referred to as PAX8-EP298 antibody) molecular genetic tests. Results: All three BSNS patients were elderly women with clinical manifestations of nasal congestion and bleeding. Imaging showed a soft tissue density shadow of the nasal cavity and sinuses with bone destruction. The boundaries of tumors which were covered with ciliated columnar epithelium were unclear, and mucosal invasion and squamous metaplasia could be seen. Tumor cells were spindle-shaped, arranged in a bundle-like, braided arrangement, with little cellular atypia and occasional atypical mitotic figures. The tumoral interstitial vessels were mostly thin-walled, some showing staghorn-like changes. There was focal striated muscle differentiation in two cases, and bone invasion was seen in two cases. IHC staining showed that all three cases of BSNS expressed PAX3 and PAX8-OTI6H8, but not PAX8-EP298. All eight cases of schwannoma, five cases of hemangiopericytoma, and one case of triton tumor did not express PAX3, PAX8-OTI6H8 or PAX8-EP298. Eight of the ten cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma expressed PAX3 and PAX8-OTI6H8, but not PAX8-EP298. Three cases of fibrosarcoma showed weak PAX3 and PAX8-OTI6H8 expression, but there was no PAX8-EP298 expression. FISH detection showed that PAX3 break apart in the tumor cells from all three patients (four specimens). Conclusions: BSNS is a distinct sinonasal low grade malignancy with dual differentiation which could be readily confused with a variety of spindle cell tumors encountered in the sinonasal cavity. The molecular genetics of PAX3 gene break is the gold standard for diagnosis of this tumor. IHC marker monoclonal PAX3 is 100% expressed in BSNS, while the specificity is limited. PAX8-OTI6H8 is also expressed in BSNS due to the cross reaction with PAX3 antibody, while PAX8-EP298 is all negative for these tumors.	BSNS	 biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma
[Clinicopathological and molecular genetic features of lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor].	33287512	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological and molecular genetic features of lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor(LPF-NT). Methods: Three cases of LPF-NT in Children's Hospital of Fudan University from December 2018 to December 2019 were analyzed for their diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Results: One case was male and two cases were females, all of them aged under 1 years old. The clinical manifestation of LPF-NT was a local infiltrative growth mass in subcutaneous tissue. There were no specific radiologic features. Histologically, dense fascicles or compact sheets of spindle cells showed infiltration into subcutaneous adipose tissue. Spindle cells displayed a moderate degree of nuclear atypia with mitotic activity cells.Immunohistochemical study showed the tumor cells diffusely expressed S-100 protein, CD34, NTRKI, and pan-TRK. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected rearrangement of NTRK1 gene in all 3 cases tested. Conclusions: LPF-NT is a newly named soft tissue tumor. Histological morphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular detection are helpful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the disease.	-NT	 lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor(LPF
[Pathological diagnosis of Danon disease by endomyocardial biopsy].	33287513	Objective To investigate the clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of Danon disease. Methods: Two cases of Danon disease were selected from Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from January 2019 to December 2019. The clinical history, histological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and gene mutation analysis were collected. Results: Both of the patients were male, aged 21 and 19 years old, respectively. They were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by clinicians. The histologic features of endocardial biopsies were hypertrophy and vacuolar degeneration of cardiomyocytes. Part of cardiomyocytes appeared as intracellular clear areas lacking myofibers. The nuclei were large, irregular and hyperchromatic. And lipofuscin was occasionally observed in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Ultrastructural feature of electron microscopic was glycogen accumulation. Genetic analysis identified two lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) gene mutations. A 1-bp deletion in exon 8 (c.973delC) was found in patient 1, leading to a frame-shift mutation. A 3-bp duplication in exon 5 (c.719_721dupAGC) was found in patient 2, leading to an insertion mutation. Conclusions: Danon disease is a rare disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is caused by mutations in the LAMP2 gene. Vacuolar degeneration of cardiomyocytes, glycogen accumulation under electron microscope and the mutation of LAMP2 gene are the critical features of Danon disease. Familiar with its clinicopathological characteristics would be helpful to avoid the misdiagnosis of Danon disease.	LAMP2	 lysosome-associated membrane protein-2
[Clinicopathological characterization of primary pulmonary and tracheal glomus tumors].	33287514	Objective: To investigate the clinical pathological features of primary pulmonary and tracheal glomus tumors. Methods: The clinical and pathological features of 11 cases (4 cases from Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, China and 7 cases from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, China) of respiratory glomus tumor diagnosed from 2010 to 2019 were analyzed, and reviewed in light of the relevant literature. Results: In the 11 cases, there were 5 males and 6 females, with the onset ages of 29‒66 years (median age of 43). Six tumors were located in the lung, and 5 in the trachea. The tumor diameters ranged 1.0‒7.5 cm, with the average diameter of 2.6 cm. At low magnification, the tumors were diffuse or lobulated in shape. The tumor cells composed of sheets of oval to short spindle cells, with sharply defined cell border and prominent branching thin-walled vessels. Among the 4 benign glomus tumors, one was classified as benign symplastic glomus tumor owing to the hyperchromatic or degeneration nuclei. Two cases were classified as glomus tumors of uncertain malignant potential, on the account of cellular atypia and rare atypical mitotic figures. Five cases were classified as malignant glomus tumors, owing to the tumor necrosis, vascular invasion, marked nuclear atypia, prominent nucleoli and brisk mitoses (2-20/10HPF) including pathological mitotic figures. The tumor cells showed strong immunostaining for SMA, vimentin, type Ⅳ collagen and caldesmon to different extents, while CD34, cytokeratin and S-100 stains were negative. One of the cases was positive for desmin, and one case positive for synaptophysin. Follow-up information was available in 8 patients with the duration ranging from 6 to 95 months. At the end of the follow-up, 6 patients were alive without recurrence or metastasis, and two of the patients with malignant glomus tumors died. Conclusions: Primary pulmonary and tracheal glomus tumors is rare. Among the reported cases, malignant glomus tumor is the most frequent, followed by benign glomus tumors and uncertain malignant potential glomus tumors. Glomus tumors show sheet-like growth pattern and clusters of round epithelioid cells with numerous vascular spaces. They can be easily misdiagnosed as carcinoid tumor. The final diagnosis should be combined with immunohistochemical staining, such as SMA, caldesmon and vimentin.	2-20/10HPF	 brisk mitoses
[Often misdiagnosed primary pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: a clinicopathological analysis of five cases].	33287515	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of primary pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). Methods: Five cases of pleural EHE diagnosed from 2012 to 2019 in the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital of Tongji University, China, were collected. They were subjected to review of clinical and image data, reevaluation of histological sections, immunohistochemistry study, clinical follow up and literature review. Results: There were 1 male and 4 females (male to female ratio of 1∶4). The age ranged 19‒58 years, with a median age of 52 years. There was no smoking history in all 5 cases. Clinical manifestations included chest distress, chest pain, cough and hemoptysis. CT scan showed pleural effusion, pleural thickening, multiple pleural nodules and pneumothorax. All of the 5 cases were diagnosed based on thoracoscopic biopsies, which were performed for the suspicion of malignancy in 3 cases and for the suspicion of tuberculosis upon the failure of anti-tuberculosis treatment in 2 cases. Histologically, the tumors grew in the mesenchyme, forming cords, nests and solid sheets. The tumor cells were round, oval, short spindle, and polygonal in shape. They were epithelioid and had abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Blister cells (vacuoles in cytoplasm) could be seen, and for mednewly-generated vessel lumen. Mucoid degeneration and collagenization were common in the tumor stroma. The positive-stainin grate was 5/5 for vimentin, 5/5 for D2-40, 4/5 for CD31, 4/5 for ERG, 4/5 for CAMTA1, 2/5 for CD34 and 2/5 for CKpan. WT1, calretinin and CK5/6 were all negative. The follow-up time ranged from 4‒18 months. During the follow-up, 4 patients were treated with chemotherapy (2 patients died, and 2 survived with tumor), and 1 patient lost to the follow-up. Conclusions: Primary pleural EHE is rare. Its imaging and clinical features are very similar to those of tuberculosis. The correct diagnosis relies on pathological biopsy. Tumor cells are epithelioid. When CD34 is negative and D2-40 is positive, it is easy to be misdiagnosed as malignant mesothelioma. The combination of CD31, ERG and CAMTA1, which have high specificity of EHE, is helpful for the differential diagnosis.	EHE	 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma
[Effect of HIF-1α and BRD4 on autophagy level of breast cancer cell in hypoxic microenvironment].	33287516	Objective: To investigate the expressions of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1, LC3B and p62 in breast cancer tissues and their clinicopathological significance, and to study alterations of their expression in breast cancer cells under hypoxic microenvironment. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1, LC3B and p62 protein expressions in 125 breast cancer tissues and 50 para-cancer normal breast tissues, and their correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. The expression of these proteins were also measured after 24 hours of hypoxia stimulation was detected in different breast cancer cell lines and normal breast epithelial cells. Results: The expression of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B proteins in breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than in para-cancer normal breast tissues (P<0.05). There was a positive association between histologic grade, the expression of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B (P<0.05). High expressions of HIF-1a and Beclin1 were often correlated with lymph node metastasis and lymphatic invasion (P<0.05). Increased HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B expression was associated with ER or PR negativity, but only HIF-1α was associated with HER2 positivity (P<0.05). HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1, and LC3B were positively correlated with each other in breast cancer tissues (P<0.01). After 24 hours of hypoxic stimulation, the expression of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B was up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Conclusions: Hypoxia induces autophagy in breast cancer tissues. HIF-1α is positively correlated with BRD4, suggesting that BRD4 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by hypoxic microenvironment in breast cancer. High expression of HIF-1α, BRD4 and autophagy may play an important role in the development of breast cancer.	ĠHIF-1Î±	 hypoxic microenvironment

[Effect of HIF-1α and BRD4 on autophagy level of breast cancer cell in hypoxic microenvironment].	33287516	Objective: To investigate the expressions of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1, LC3B and p62 in breast cancer tissues and their clinicopathological significance, and to study alterations of their expression in breast cancer cells under hypoxic microenvironment. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1, LC3B and p62 protein expressions in 125 breast cancer tissues and 50 para-cancer normal breast tissues, and their correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. The expression of these proteins were also measured after 24 hours of hypoxia stimulation was detected in different breast cancer cell lines and normal breast epithelial cells. Results: The expression of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B proteins in breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than in para-cancer normal breast tissues (P<0.05). There was a positive association between histologic grade, the expression of HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B (P<0.05). High expressions of HIF-1a and Beclin1 were often correlated with lymph node metastasis and lymphatic invasion (P<0.05). Increased HIF-1α, BRD4, Beclin1 and LC3B expression was associated with ER or PR negativity, but only HIF-1α was associated with HER2 positivity (P<0.05).

[The value of morphological characteristics of cervical adenocarcinoma biopsy tissue in predicting tumor invasion pattern and prognosis].	33287517	Objective: To evaluate the pathologic findings from biopsy samples to predict the status of nodal metastasis for patients with usual cervical adenocarcinoma. Methods: The 32-pair samples of cervical adenocarcinoma specimens (32 cervical biopsies and 32 hysterectomies with staging) from 2013 to 2019 were selected for retrospective study in Shanghai first Maternal and infant Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University. The correlation between histopathologic features including necrotic tumor debris (NTD), nuclear grade, mitotic count and pattern-based classification system and the status of lymph node metastasis was evaluated. Results: Tumor invasive patterns of cervical adenocarcinoma, as described previously, could be discerned in hysterectomy/staging specimens, but not in cervical biopsies. Because the biopsy tissues were small, only 14(14/32, 43.8%) cases could be classified according to pattern of invasion, and the concordance rate with resected specimens was 37.5%. NTD (9/19) and grade 3 nuclei (11/19) were positively correlated with invasive pattern C and nodal metastases (P<0.05). Moreover, when NTD and (or) nuclear grade were evaluated at the same time, the sensitivity for type C infiltration was higher. Conclusions: Evaluation of NTD and nuclear grade in biopsies for cervical adenocarcinoma provides good predictive value for lymph node metastasis. It is helpful for patient stratification and management andto avoid unnecessary staging procedures. However, multicenter studies and prospective clinical trials are necessary to confirm the findings before clinical application can be considered.	NTD	 necrotic tumor debris
Degradation Trends of Some Insecticides and Microbial Changes during Sauerkraut Fermentation under Laboratory Conditions.	33287534	The aim of this study was to monitor the degradation of three insecticides licensed for the control of cabbage moths during the 14-day fermentation period of sauerkraut samples. The hypothesis of this study is that the different sauerkraut fermentation processes could affect the degradation of applied insecticides. For this purpose, the fresh cabbage leaves contaminated with (λ-cyhalothrin, malathion, and chlorpyrifos-methyl) were left for fermentation with and without (natural) starter addition (Lactobacillus plantarum 112), and vacuum-packed as a control under laboratory conditions. The pH values and microbial growth were periodically monitored in sauerkraut samples during the fermentation period. During this time, the insecticide residues were determined in control and treatment samples using LC-MS-MS. In control samples, the degradation of chlorpyrifos-methyl and malathion was higher with rates of 69 and 98%, respectively, compared with the sauerkraut samples (12 and 59%; 31 and 34%, respectively) 14 days after the insecticide application. At the end of fermentation (14 d), no significant reduction in λ-cyhalothrin was detected in both treatments and control (13-19% reduction). The current study demonstrated that the presence of the lactic acid bacteria in the sauerkraut fermentation accelerated pH decline (below 4.0), and these fermentation conditions probably decelerated the degradation of malathion and chlorpyrifos-methyl. The results showed that the stability of different insecticides varied during the same fermentation process.	-cyhalothrin	»

Spin-Filtering Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions as Multiferroic Synapses for Neuromorphic Computing.	33287535	As nanoelectronic synapses, memristive ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have triggered great interest due to the potential applications in neuromorphic computing for emulating biological brains. Here, we demonstrate multiferroic FTJ synapses based on the ferroelectric modulation of spin-filtering BaTiO3/CoFe2O4 composite barriers. Continuous conductance change with an ON/OFF current ratio of ∼54 400% and long-term memory with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of synaptic weight for Hebbian learning are achieved by controlling the polarization switching of BaTiO3. Supervised learning simulations adopting the STDP results as database for weight training are performed on a crossbar neural network and exhibit a high accuracy rate above 97% for recognition. The polarization switching also alters the band alignment of CoFe2O4 barrier relative to the electrodes, giving rise to the change of tunneling magnetoresistance ratio by about 10 times and even the reversal of its sign depending upon the resistance states. These results, especially the electrically switchable spin polarization, provide a new approach toward multiferroic neuromorphic devices with energy-efficient electrical manipulations through potential barrier design. In addition, the availability of spinel ferrite barriers epitaxially grown with ferroelectric oxides also expends the playground of FTJ devices for a broad scope of applications.

Spectral Signatures of Canthaxanthin Translocation in the Orange Carotenoid Protein.	33287537	The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is involved in the photoprotective processes in cyanobacteria via nonphotochemical quenching. Triggered by blue-green light absorption, the carotenoid chromophore undergoes translocation, displacing around 12 Å from the C-terminal domain (CTD) to the N-terminal domain (NTD). The detailed molecular rearrangements that occur within the carotenoid and the protein during this process remain largely elusive. By using a combination of molecular dynamics, well-tempered metadynamics, and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, we were able to mimic the translocation of the carotenoid from the inactive OCPO and obtain metastable red-shifted states in the photoactivation mechanism, replicating the λmax values of reference experimental spectra. In addition, our simulations give insight into the structure of the red-shifted form of the inactive state of OCP.	QM/MM	 quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical

Gate Bias Stress Instability and Hysteresis Characteristics of InAs Nanowire Field-Effect Transistors.	33287538	Because of the excellent electrical properties, III-V semiconductor nanowires are promising building blocks for next-generation electronics; however, their rich surface states inevitably contribute large amounts of charge traps, leading to gate bias stress instability and hysteresis characteristics in nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we investigated thoroughly the gate bias stress and hysteresis effects in InAs nanowire FETs. It is observed that the output current decreases together with the threshold voltage shifting to the positive direction when a positive gate bias stress is applied, and vice versa for the negative gate bias stress. For double-sweep transfer characteristics, the significant hysteresis behavior is observed, depending heavily on the sweeping rate and range. On the basis of complementary investigations of these devices, charge traps are confirmed to be the dominant factor for these instability effects. Importantly, the hysteresis can be simulated well by utilizing a combination of the rate equation for electron density and the empirical model for electron mobility. This provides an accurate evaluation of carrier mobility, which is in distinct contrast to the overestimation of mobility when using the transconductance for calculation. All these findings are important for understanding the charge trap dynamics to further enhance the device performance of nanowire FETs.	FETs	 field-effect transistors
Decisive Role of 5f-Orbital Covalence in the Structure and Stability of Pentavalent Transuranic Oxo [M6O8] Clusters.	33287539	Actinide metal oxo clusters are of vital importance in actinide chemistry, as well as in environmental and materials sciences. They are ubiquitous in both aqueous and nonaqueous phases and play key roles in nuclear materials (e.g., nuclear fuel) and nuclear waste management. Despite their importance, our structural understanding of the actinide metal oxo clusters, particularly the transuranic ones, is very limited because of experimental challenges such as high radioactivity. Herein we report a systematic theoretical study on the structures and stabilities of seven actinide metal oxo-hydroxo clusters [AnIV6O4(OH)4L12] (1-An; An = Th-Cm; L = O2CH-) along with their group 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf, Rf) and lanthanide (Ce) counterparts [MIV6O4(OH)4L12] (1-M). The work shows the Td-symmetric structures of all of the 1-An/M clusters and suggests the positions of the -OH functional groups, which are experimentally challenging to determine. Furthermore, by removing six electrons from 1-An, we found that oxidation could happen on the AnIV metal ions, producing [AnV6O4(OH)4L12]6+ (2-An; An = Pa, U, Np), or on the O2- and OH- ligands, producing [AnIV6(O•-)4(OH•)2(OH)2L12]6+ (3-An; An = Pu, Am, Cm). On the basis of 2-An, we constructed a series of tetravalent and pentavalent actinide metal oxo clusters [AnIV6O14]4- (4-An) and [AnV6O14]2+ (5-An), which proves the feasibility of the highly important pentavalent actinyl clusters, demonstrates the f orbital's structure-directing role in the formation of linear [O≡AnV═O]+ actinyl ions, and expands the concept of actinyl-actinyl interaction into pentavalent transuranic actinyl clusters.	4-An	 actinide

Direct Transfer of Phthalate and Alternative Plasticizers from Indoor Source Products to Dust: Laboratory Measurements and Predictive Modeling.	33287540	Phthalate and alternative plasticizers are semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and among the most abundant indoor pollutants. Although ingestion of dust is one of the major exposure pathways to them, migration knowledge from source products to indoor dust is still limited. Systematic chamber measurements were conducted to investigate the direct transfer of these SVOCs between source products and dust in contact with the source. Substantial direct source-to-dust transfer of SVOCs was observed for all tests. The concentration of bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate in dust was 12 times higher than the pre-experimental level after only two days of source-dust contact. A mechanistic model was developed to predict the direct transfer process, and a reasonable agreement between model predictions and measurements was achieved. The octanol/air partition coefficient (Koa) of SVOCs, the emission parameter of the source product (y0), and the characteristics of the dust layer (i.e., porosity and thickness) control the transfer, affecting the SVOC concentration in dust, the kinetics of direct transfer, or both. Dust mass loading has a significant influence on the transfer, while relative humidity only has a limited effect. The findings suggest that minimizing the use of SVOC-containing products and house vacuuming are effective intervention strategies to reduce young children's exposure to SVOCs.

Representing Exact Electron Densities by a Single Slater Determinant in Finite Basis Sets.	33287541	The premise for Kohn-Sham density functional theory is that the exact electron density can be generated by a set of orbitals in a single Slater determinant. While this is ensured in a complete basis set, it has been shown that it cannot hold in small basis sets. The present work probes how accurately a reference electron density of the full-CI type can be reproduced by a set of orbitals in a single Slater determinant, as a function of the basis set used for the fitting electron density. The key finding is that the fitting error may be significant for basis sets of double- or triple-ζ quality. It is also shown that it is important that the fitting basis set includes the same basis functions as used for generating the reference electron density. The main limitation in a given basis set is the lack of higher order polarization functions. The error for practical purposes becomes insignificant for basis sets of quadruple-ζ or better quality, and this should be the choice when assessing the accuracy of exchange-correlation functionals by comparing electron densities to accurate reference results generated by wave function methods. The methodology in the present work can be used to transform an electron density from a multideterminant wave function into a set of orbitals in a single Slater determinant, and this may be useful for developing and testing new exchange-correlation functionals.

Metabolic Engineering of Pseudomonas chlororaphis Qlu-1 for the Enhanced Production of Phenazine-1-carboxamide.	33287542	Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), the primary active ingredient of Shenqinmycin, was awarded the China Pesticide Certificate in 2011 due to its excellent antibacterial action. Phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) is a derivative of PCA, which is modified by the phzH gene, and its anti-bacterial effect is better than that of PCA. At present, PCN can be produced via Pseudomonas fermentation using an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Qlu-1 is an environmentally friendly strain of Pseudomonas chlororaphis that can produce phenazine derivatives. We replaced the phzO gene with the phzH gene from P. aeruginosa to achieve PCN accumulation. Different strategies were used to enhance PCN production: knocking out of negative regulatory factors, enhancing the shikimate pathway by gene overexpression and gene knocking, and using fed-batch fermentation. Finally, an engineered strain of P. chlororaphis was produced, which produced 11.45 g/L PCN. This achievement indicates that Qlu-1 could be modified as a potential microbial cell factory for PCN production by metabolic engineering.	PCN	 Phenazine-1-carboxamide

We replaced the phzO gene with the phzH gene from P. aeruginosa to achieve PCN accumulation. Different strategies were used to enhance PCN production: knocking out of negative regulatory factors, enhancing the shikimate pathway by gene overexpression and gene knocking, and using fed-batch fermentation. Finally, an engineered strain of P. chlororaphis was produced, which produced 11.45 g/L PCN. This achievement indicates that Qlu-1 could be modified as a potential microbial cell factory for PCN production by metabolic engineering.	PCA	 Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid
Self-Regeneration Process of Ni-Cu Alloy Catalysts during a Three-Way Catalytic Reaction-An Operando Study.	33287543	It is important to understand the reduction processes of mixed metal oxides or metal oxide interfaces in three-way catalytic reactions toward replacing the currently used high-cost Pt group metal catalysts. The redox behavior of simple Ni-Cu alloy catalysts, which exhibit high catalytic activity and durability during a three-way catalytic reaction, was studied by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The operando XAS analyses revealed that Ni-Cu species changed from the NiO-Cu2O to Ni-Cu alloy and vice versa under reductive and oxidative conditions, respectively. The real-time monitoring of the oxidation states of Ni and Cu species indicated that the Cu species assisted the reduction of Ni species, in agreement with the density functional theory-based study of NiO reduction by carbon monoxide in the presence of metallic Cu nanoparticles.

Photoreaction Dynamics of a Full-Length Protein YtvA and Intermolecular Interaction with RsbRA.	33287544	YtvA from Bacillus subtilis is a sensor protein that responds to blue light stress and regulates the activity of transcription factor σB. It is composed of the N-terminal LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain, the C-terminal STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain, and a linker region connecting them. In this study, the photoreaction and kinetics of full-length YtvA and the intermolecular interaction with a downstream protein, RsbRA, were revealed by the transient grating method. Although N-YLOV-linker, which is composed of the LOV domain of YtvA with helices A'α and Jα, exhibits a diffusion change due to the rotational motion of the helices, the YtvA dimer does not show the diffusion change. This result suggests that the STAS domain inhibits the rotational movement of helices A'α and Jα. We found that the YtvA dimer formed a heterotetramer with the RsbRA dimer probably via the interaction between the STAS domains, and we showed the diffusion change upon blue light illumination with a time constant faster than 70 μs. This result suggests a conformational change of the STAS domains; i.e., the interface between the STAS domains of the proteins changes to enhance the friction with water by the rotation structural change of helices A'α and Jα of YtvA.

Patient Perspectives of Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy Services in Kiribati: A Qualitative Study.	33287551	Diabetes mellitus is an increasing global health problem affecting millions of people worldwide, especially true in the Republic of Kiribati, with >20% of adults suffering from type 2 diabetes, and the prevalence is rising. Information on I-Kiribati patients' understanding of diabetes and perception of access to relevant services is sparse. This study explores patient perspectives on their condition and its management using Talanga and Kakala Pacific research methodologies. Data were collected from Kiribati patients in 4 focus group interviews. Key themes to emerge were knowledge about diabetes, understanding and accessing the health care system, making lifestyle changes, and suggestions for improvement. Health system failures to meet the complex health care needs of these patients and health care services gaps are apparent. Improvements suggested include a comprehensive village-based health promotion and community development program focusing on youth and schools from early childhood and onward, increase in the skilled workforce, and an integrated approach to service delivery.

Effectiveness of a Singaporean Community-Based Physical Activity and Nutrition Intervention: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.	33287553	This study examined the effectiveness of a 6-month intervention to improve the health behaviors and outcomes among women aged 50 years and older. A sample of 580 (intervention n = 295; control n = 285) women was recruited from 26 recreational centers. Only the intervention group participated in the Singapore Physical Activity (PA) and Nutrition Study (SPANS), received health resources (calendar, recipe, and booklets) and motivational support from program ambassadors. The intervention group showed significant improvements in moderate-intensity PA, vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA (P < .001), increased intake frequency of fruit and vegetables (P = .049), a reduction in salt and sugary beverage intake (P ≤ .042), and reductions in systolic blood pressure (BP; -3.68 mm Hg), diastolic BP (-3.54 mm Hg), and percentage body fat (-2.13%; P ≤ .020) when compared with the control group. The SPANS appeared to be efficacious in improving PA and dietary behaviors, reducing BP and percentage body fat among Singaporean women.	BP	 blood pressure

At registration users identify themselves as male, female, transgender or intersex. We aimed to establish whether adolescent transgender users of SPARX, compared to adolescent male and female users, were more likely to have high mental health needs at baseline and were more likely to complete SPARX. We also sought to determine changes in transgender adolescents' depressive symptoms after using SPARX.	ĠSPARX	 New Zealand
Mycotoxins in food: a review on liquid chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry and their experimental designs.	33287555	The development of a multi-mycotoxins method using LC-MS/MS is necessary and it is clear that the development of such method involves many compromises in the choice of the different parameters. This review summarizes applications using conventional experimental designs and some recent studies using response surface methodology (RSM) as a mathematical modeling tool for the optimization of extraction procedures. The authors also discuss pros and cons of the different procedures. To our knowledge, it is the first review on experimental design for the development of multi-mycotoxin methods. This review could be useful in the development and optimization of LC-MS/MS methods with the aim of describing experimental design and variables (factors) that are likely to affect sensitivity and specificity.

[Adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in routine care: A representative survey].	33287563	Adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in routine care: A representative survey Abstract. Objective: The study evaluated guideline adherence in the current routine care of children and adolescents with Attention Deficit-/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in various groups of healthcare providers nationwide. Method: N = 275 providers from all relevant groups of a Germany-wide random sample (specialists in pediatric and adolescent medicine, child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy, child and adolescent psychotherapists and all Social Pediatric Centers, outpatient departments of child and adolescent psychiatric clinics and behavioral therapy training institutes) participated in an online interview. Results: The recommendations in the guidelines were implemented on average in 75-100 % of the patients. Exceptions were those of teacher/educator exploration and school interventions. Questionnaires on diagnostics and follow-up or psychotherapeutic interventions were applied comparatively rarely, in about 50 % of the patients. Differences between provider groups and correlations with sociodemographic variables were analyzed at the level of the adherence indices. Conclusions: Overall, the participants reported high guideline adherence. We found a high similarity of the data in different care segments within the care providers. Differences in self-reports of the various care groups stimulate considerations of the roles in the care process with ADHD patients.	ADHD	 Attention Deficit-/Hyperactivity Disorder
School absenteeism as a potential proxy of functionality in pediatric patients with somatic symptom and related disorders.	33287565	"Little is known about the school functioning of youth who are medically admitted with somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD). The current study examines school absenteeism and associated factors in medically hospitalized children and adolescents with SSRDs. Retrospective data were reviewed of 243 patients aged 5 to 18 years admitted at a pediatric hospital from 2012 to 2014, referred to the Psychiatry Consultation Service and diagnosed with an SSRD. Only 10% of patients had normal school attendance in the past year and approximately 40% had severe school absenteeism (i.e. missed > 1 month of school). No association was found between school absenteeism and caregiver report of learning difficulties/disabilities. Patients with severe school absenteeism were more likely to be between the ages of 15 and 17, with higher somatization and functional disability scores, higher rates of suicidal ideation and/or attempts, greater psychotropic medication use and psychiatry sessions during admission, and greater rates of discharge to a higher level of psychiatric care. Findings from this study suggest that screening for school absenteeism during clinical visits by use of a single question ""how many school days have you (or has your child) missed this past school year,"" may serve as a proxy for functional disability and an indicator of psychiatric, and somatic symptom severity concerns."

Brokering science, blaming culture: The US-South Korea ecological survey in the Demilitarized Zone, 1963-8.	33287575	This paper examines the planning, execution, and closure of the US-Korea Cooperative Ecological Survey project in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the 1960s. In this period, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) initiated bilateral scientific cooperation between the NAS and similar organizations in developing countries along the line of the developmental turn of U.S. foreign assistance. Working closely with the NAS, U.S. conservationists used this scheme to introduce nature conservation practices and the discipline of ecosystem ecology to developing countries. In this context, by way of the NAS's Pacific Science Board, two countries' biologists initiated the preliminary cooperative project in the DMZ in 1966. Korean and U.S. scientists soon began to realize that their collaboration was marked by dissonance. The U.S. side attributed the cooperation failure to Korean culture while the Korean side criticized the unequal structure of their cooperation. Joining the global historiography of Cold War scientific collaboration, this paper pays particular attention to the intermediaries of the collaborative project and their rivalry. It argues that political struggles revolving around the position of go-betweens - as what I call knowledge brokers - on the recipient side provoked contestation between American and Korean scientists. The contention between the two sides played out in the collaboration coming to an end, albeit partially. Throughout this analysis, this study suggests paying more serious attention to the politics of scientific exchange among actors on the recipient side as an outset from which to analyze the heterogeneity of the Korean side without losing sight of their active role in the building process of American hegemony.

[Psychotic disorders in ICD-11: the revisions].	33287579	"Psychotic disorders in ICD-11: the revisions Abstract. This article provides an overview of the main changes to the chapter ""Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders"" (6A2) from ICD-10 to ICD-11 and compares them with the psychosis chapter of DSM-5. These changes include abandoning the classical subtypes of Schizophrenia as well as of the special significance of Schneider's first-rank symptoms, resulting in the general requirement of two key features (one must be a positive symptom) in the definition of ""Schizophrenia"" (6A20) and the allowance for bizarre contents in ""Delusional Disorder"" (6A24), which now includes ""Induced Delusional Disorder"" (F24). Further introduced are the focus on the current episode, the restriction of ""Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder"" (6A23) to the former Polymorphic Disorder Without Schizophrenic Symptoms (F23.0), the diagnosis of delusional ""Obsessive-Compulsive or Related Disorders"" (6B2) exclusively as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, the specification of ""Schizoaffective Disorder"" (6A21), and the formulation of a distinct subchapter ""Catatonia"" (6A4) for the assessment of catatonic features in the context of several disorders. In analogy to DSM-5, ICD-11 now includes the optional category ""Symptomatic Manifestations of Primary Psychotic Disorders"" (6A25) for the dimensional quantification of symptoms. Again, developmental aspects remain unattended in in the ICD-11-definitions of psychotic disorders."	ĠICD-11	Induced Delusional Disorder
Changing Perspectives: Offloading a Patient With a Diabetic Foot Ulcer as Opposed to Offloading a Diabetic Foot Ulcer.	33287580	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a tremendous burden to health care systems. Offloading is one of the key tenants to healing DFU and knee-high irremovable offloading devices are considered the gold standard for offloading DFU. However, the gold standard is rarely utilized in clinical practice. Patients' limited tolerance for such devices is one of a number of reasons that have been attributed to the lack of use of these devices. The practice of evidence-based medicine relies on shared decision making by pairing patients' values and preferences with the best available evidence. The present case report reviews the process of a patient-centered approach to identify the best offloading option for a patient with DFU. In consultation with the patient, a series of modalities were evaluated for offloading 2 unilateral forefoot DFUs. It is suggested that optimizing DFU offloading outcomes at the population level will require concerted efforts to employ the best offloading solution at the individual patient level. Offloading modalities are necessitated to mitigate the physical stress imparted on DFU during the weightbearing activity that patients engage in. Success is likely to be maximized by maintaining a mind-set of treating individual patients with DFUs as opposed to simply treating DFUs.Levels of Evidence: Level V: Case report.

Timing of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Readmitted Patients with Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	33287581	Early pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), started during hospitalization or within the first month after discharge, has been shown to reduce exacerbations and improve health-related-quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity. However, no randomized clinical trials (RCT) have compared the efficacy of PR started during hospitalization (DHPR) to PR initiated one month post-hospitalization (PHPR). We conducted an RCT to compare DHPR to PHPR in severe patients with COPD readmitted for exacerbations in a tertiary hospital setting. Patients were randomized to receive three months of DHPR or PHPR. Outcomes were assessed at completion of the PR programme and at months 3 and 9. A total of 53 patients (26 DHPR and 27 PHPR) were included. There were no between-group differences in the number of exacerbations (mean, 3.62 vs. 3.04 in the DHPR and PHPR groups, respectively; p = 0.403). Dyspnea in activities of daily living, exercise capacity, and all HRQoL parameters improved in the PHPR group. In the DHPR group, improvement was observed only for some HRQoL parameters. All gains in both groups were lost during follow-up. More adverse events were observed in the DHPR group (20 vs 5, p = 0.023), although none of these were clinically significant. In this sample of patients with severe COPD readmitted to the hospital for exacerbations, both approaches to PR were safe, but PHPR yielded better outcomes overall. These findings suggest that, PR should be initiated in patients with severe COPD only after hospital discharge when the patients' clinical condition has stabilized.	RCT	 randomized clinical trials

Hb Athens-Georgia (beta 40(C6) Arg > Lys, HBB:c.122G > A) with a single α-globin gene (Hb H disease) in a Thai family: molecular, hematological, and diagnostic aspects.	33287582	Interaction of structural hemoglobin (Hb) variants with α- or β-globin defects are occasional in Southeast Asia. Herein we provide the first description of Hb Athens-Georgia (Hb A-Ga) in association with deletional Hb H disease, a novel combination previously undescribed in the population. Hematological, Hb and DNA analysis, and β-globin haplotype analyses were performed in seven participants from one ethnic Thai family. Hemoglobin analysis by capillary electrophoresis revealed an abnormal Hb fraction in the proband, his father and grandmother (I-2). DNA sequencing revealed that the G > A substitution at codon 40 of the β-globin gene was identical to the Hb A-Ga (HBB:c.122G > A). Interestingly, α-thal-1 (SEA deletion) and α-thal-2 (-α3.7 deletion) were identified in the proband resulting in Hb H disease, while α-thal-1 was identified in the father, and no α-thal was observed in I-2. Hematological analysis indicated that the proband (βA-Ga/βA, -SEA/-α3.7) had moderate anemia and was markedly hypochromic with microcytic red blood cells (RBCs).

Current monitoring and treatment of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease: a survey of physicians in Japan, the United States, and the European Union.	33287583	Objective To understand assumptions and approaches to interstitial lung disease (ILD), including those of the progressive phenotype (progressive fibrosing ILD), this multinational survey assessed physicians' attitudes toward, knowledge of, and management strategies for progressive fibrosing ILD. Methods This internet-based survey of physicians was conducted between 11/2018 and 02/2019. Practical management strategies for progressive fibrosing ILD, and current approaches to the assessment and treatment of ILD, were compared between countries/regions (Japan vs. United States and European Union) and specialties (pulmonologists vs. rheumatologists). Results The survey was completed by 574 respondents. Compared with Western countries, the progressive fibrosing phenotype concept was not widely understood by Japanese respondents, with no notable differences in the understanding of this phenotype between pulmonologists and rheumatologists. Across all regions, pulmonary function tests, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide assessments, and pulse oximeter measurements were commonly performed at intervals of ≤6 months. In general, physicians in the United States and European Union preferred physiologic approaches for follow-up, while those in Japan preferred imaging and blood monitoring. Compared with rheumatologists, pulmonologists performed more frequent monitoring of autoimmune ILDs, and the differences between specialties were most pronounced in Japan. Regional differences in treatment approaches were observed, probably reflecting the local availability of agents and healthcare environments. Conclusions Awareness and management of progressive fibrosing ILD varied between specialties and regions, highlighting an unmet need for standardized diagnosis, treatment guidelines, and specialist education in this area.

Cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and acute oral toxicity of aqueous Ocotea minarum leaf extracts.	33287587	Ocotea minarum (Nees & Mart.) Mez., a native species of Brazil, is used in the treatment of infections and oxidative stress; however, there is no scientific evidence of its toxicological characteristics. We assessed the cytotoxicity, mutagenic activity, and acute oral toxicity of the aqueous extract isolated from O. minarum leaves. The cytotoxicity of this extract was evaluated in tumour and non-tumour cell lines, while the Ames test with a Salmonella Typhimurium was used to determine the mutagenic activity. Wistar rats received a single 2 g/kg dose as part of an LD50 toxicity assessment. Our results showed that the aqueous extract of O. minarum leaves did not present cytotoxic and mutagenic properties and was not toxic, with an LD50 greater than 2 g/kg. Therefore, the O. minarum extracts are pharmacologically safe and can continue to be investigated for the development of new drugs and herbal medicines.	ĠLD50	 stress

Neurological consequences of exercise during prenatal Zika virus exposure to mice pups.	33287589	Purpose/Aim: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during the pregnancy period is related to microcephaly and neurobehavioral disorders at birth, while prenatal exercise is supposed to provide neuroprotection in newborns pups. The aim of this study was to investigate the neurological consequences of exercise during prenatal ZIKV exposure to mice pups. Material and methods: Twelve weeks female mice were randomly assigned into three groups: Control group, intraperitoneally injected with saline (Control); untrained group, intraperitoneally injected with ZIKV (ZIKV); and trained group, intraperitoneally injected with ZIKV (ZIKV/swim). There was one familiarization week prior to the beginning of the swimming training. Dams swam for 60 min/session, 5 days/week, during 4 weeks. Mating occurred between the fifth and seventh day of the first week of the swimming training. ZIKV 106 plaque-forming units/100 μl (106 PFUs/100 μl) or an equal volume of saline was intraperitoneally injected in the pregnant mice at embryonic day 10.5. Pup's body mass and brain weight were measured at postnatal day 1 (P1). Behavioral tests were performed from P30 to P35. Thereafter, hippocampal levels of syntaxin-1, GFAP, IBA-1, and BDNF were measured. Results: Exercise during prenatal ZIKV exposure prevented brain atrophy, development of depression, anxiety, and disruption of social behavior. Exercise during prenatal ZIKV exposure inhibited the overexpression of microglia (IBA-1) and astrocytes (GFAP), with reduction of BDNF levels in the hippocampi of female and male mice pups. No significant changes were seen in syntaxin-1 levels. Conclusion: Our findings reveal beneficial effects of exercise during pregnancy exposure to ZIKV in mice pups.

Cardiac contractility modulation for the treatment of moderate to severe HF.	33287592	Introduction: Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million Americans and approximately 650,000 new cases are diagnosed annually, with patients evenly split between HFrEF and HFpEF. Recent advances in therapy for these patients have been limited to pharmaceutical agents, with CRT remaining the most reliable device therapy option since its advent almost twenty years ago. In 2019, after almost two decades without the introduction of a new device therapy for the treatment of moderate HF, the FDA approved CCM® therapy, delivered by the Optimizer Smart device, for patients with NYHA Class III HF who are on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and with EF ranging from 25% to 45%, and who are ineligible for CRT. Areas covered: Multiple clinical trials support the use of CCM to improve quality of life, functional class, and 6-min hall walk distance. This article will discuss the science behind CCM therapy, the presumed mechanisms of action, the pre-clinical studies that shaped subsequent endeavors, and the clinical trials that support its use.

Anti-apoptotic effect of silymarin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles on hippocampal Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.	33287594	Background: Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) causes memory and learning impairments and apoptosis in the hippocampus. The aim of present study aimed to investigate the anti-apoptotic effects of silymarin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SM-CS-NPs) on the expression of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 genes in hippocampal neurons after I/R injury. Material and methods: SM and SM-CS-NPs were orally administered (15 mg/kg) for 14 days, and then cerebral I/R injury was induced by the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). One day after I/R induction, memory and learning impairments and various biochemical estimations were assessed. Results: Our results indicated that SM-CS-NPs improved I/R-induced memory and learning impairments and oxidative damage in the hippocampal region. The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that SM-CS-NPs pretreatment inhibited I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bcl-2 and decreasing the expression of Caspase-3 in the hippocampus. Conclusion: These findings suggest that SM-CS-NPs exert neuroprotective effects, and the neuroprotection is likely to be associated with the regulation of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3, leading to inhibition of apoptotic cell death in hippocampal neurons.

Ergothioneine Mitigates Telomere Shortening under Oxidative Stress Conditions.	33287595	Shortened telomeres are associated with aging and age-related diseases. Oxidative stress is thought to be a major contributor to telomere shortening, and antioxidants may be able to mitigate these effects. Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring amino acid with potent antioxidant properties. In order to investigate ergothioneine's effects on telomere length, we cultured primary human fibroblasts under standard and oxidative (10 µM H2O2) conditions and treated cells with 0.04, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/ml ergothioneine for 8 weeks. Telomere length measurements were performed using high-throughput quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (HT Q-FISH). Treatment with ergothioneine transiently increased relative telomerase activity after 24 h (p < 0.05 for all concentrations). Under oxidative conditions, ergothioneine treatment resulted in significantly longer median telomere length and 20th percentile telomere length, and significantly reduced the percentage of short telomeres (<3 kilobase pairs) for all treatment concentrations after 8 weeks. Telomere shortening rate was also reduced. Overall, ergothioneine demonstrated beneficial effects by decreasing the rate of telomere shortening and preserving telomere length under oxidative stress conditions. Our data support a potential role for ergothioneine in oxidative stress-related conditions and healthy aging.	ĠQ-FISH	 quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization
Nutraceutical Induction and Mimicry of Heme Oxygenase Activity as a Strategy for Controlling Excitotoxicity in Brain Trauma and Ischemic Stroke: Focus on Oxidative Stress.	33287596	Introduction: Ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury are leading causes of acute mortality, and in the longer run, major causes of significant mental and physical impairment. Most of the brain neuronal cell death in the minutes and hours following an ischemic stroke or brain trauma is mediated by the process of excitotoxicity, in which sustained elevations of extracellular glutamate, reflecting a failure of ATP-dependent mechanism which sequester glutamate in neurons and astrocytes, drive excessive activation of NMDA receptors. Areas covered: A literature search was undertaken to clarify the molecular mechanisms whereby excessive NMDA activation leads to excitotoxic neuronal death, and to determine what safe nutraceutical agents might have practical potential for rescuing at-risk neurons by intervening in these mechanisms. Expert opinion: Activation of both NADPH oxidase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the microenvironment of activated NMDA receptors drives production of superoxide and highly toxic peroxynitrite. This leads to excessive activation of PARP and p38 MAP kinase, mitochondrial dysfunction, and subsequent neuronal death. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction offers protection via inhibition of NADPH oxidase and promotion of cGMP generation. Phase 2-inductive nutraceuticals can induce HO-1, and other nutraceuticals can mimic the effects of its products biliverdin and carbon monoxide.	HO-1	 Heme oxygenase-1
Case analyses of state-sponsored asthma quality improvement interventions - benefits and technical assistance efforts.	33287598	A cross-case analysis was used to discover how two states benefitted from expanded use of evaluation for asthma quality improvement initiatives. If an asthma quality improvement (QI) initiative is successfully evaluated, data can inform how to effectively integrate clinical practice guidelines and circumvent non-clinical reasons that interrupt QI projects such as low staff interest. This article addresses a gap in the literature on quality of evaluation support needed to improve and sustain asthma QI at local health care organizations by describing the similar discoveries observed at two independent QI statewide initiatives in State 1 and State 2.

HSP47: a potential target for fibrotic diseases and implications for therapy.	33287600	"Introduction: Chronic fibrotic disorders are challenging clinical problems. The major challenge is the identification of specific targets expressed selectively in fibrotic tissues to avoid potential side effects of inhibiting ubiquitous factors in healthy tissues. Extensive collagen accumulation is the hallmark of fibrotic diseases. HSP47 is a collagen-specific chaperon that has a critical role in the folding of collagens. The current review will discuss the anti-fibrotic potential of targeting HSP47. Areas covered: This review compiles data from the literature retrieved by searching the PubMed database using the keywords ""HSP47 + fibrosis"" from 01/2005 to 06/2020. We examined 1) collagen biology and its role in fibrotic diseases, 2) the role of HSP47 in collagen biology and fibrosis, 3) recent HSP47 inhibition strategies and 4) clinical investigation on HSP47 inhibition in fibrotic disorders. The identification of the HSP47-collagen binding site led to the development of reliable methods to screen HSP47 inhibitors with anti-fibrotic potential. Specific in vivo delivery systems of HSP47 siRNA to fibrotic tissue reduced collagen production/secretion associated with fibrosis inhibition in preclinical models. This strategy is about to be tested in clinical trials. Expert opinion: As a collagen specific chaperon, HSP47 is a promising therapeutic target in fibrosis. Preclinical models have shown encouraging anti-fibrotic results. As of yet, anti-HSP47 strategies need to be further evaluated in clinical trials. Moreover, the increase in circulating HSP47 in lung fibrosis patients highlights the potential of HSP47 as a non-invasive biomarker and may represent an important step toward personalized medicine in fibrotic disorders."

This strategy is about to be tested in clinical trials. Expert opinion: As a collagen specific chaperon, HSP47 is a promising therapeutic target in fibrosis. Preclinical models have shown encouraging anti-fibrotic results. As of yet, anti-HSP47 strategies need to be further evaluated in clinical trials. Moreover, the increase in circulating HSP47 in lung fibrosis patients highlights the potential of HSP47 as a non-invasive biomarker and may represent an important step toward personalized medicine in fibrotic disorders."

Novel Alterations of CC2D1A as a Candidate Gene in a Turkish Sample of Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder.	33287601	Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with large genetic background, but identification of pathogenic variants has proceeded slowly because hundreds of loci are involved in this complex disorder. CC2D1A gene firstly associated with the intellectual disability (ID) in a family with a large deletion. We aimed to contribute to the literature by sequencing this gene and by this way we report novel CC2D1A variations in patients with ASD. Methods: Forty families who have a child with a diagnosis of ASD were enrolled to the study. DNA samples were obtained from each family member. Bidirectional CC2D1A gene sequencing was performed with CEQ Cycle Sequencing Kit and the products were analyzed on the Beckman CEQ 8000. All of the genetic analysis was conducted in Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell Center (GENKOK). Results: According to the sequencing results we defined new alterations in this gene with two SNPs in exon 15 and 19 (rs747172992 and rs1364074600) in our patients. We were found a pathogenic variant in one patient. This variant was located in the acceptor region. Six of the variants were missense mutations. Additionally, six different benign variants were detected in 30 patients however; they were not associated with ASD. Two patients carried multiple rare variants. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo functional analysis with this gene will help to understand its contribution to ASD pathogenesis. Future studies may help to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of these variants leading to the autism phenotype.	ASD	 Autism spectrum disorder
Indoor-related microbe damage induces complement system activation in building users.	33287602	In this comparative study, serum complement system antimicrobial activity was measured from 159 serum samples, taken from individuals from microbe-damaged (70 samples) and from reference buildings (89 samples). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using a probe-based bacterial Escherichia coli-lux bioluminescence system and comparison was made at a group level between the experimental and reference group. The complement activity was higher in users of microbe-damaged buildings compared with the reference group and the significant (P < 0.001) increase in activity was found in the classical reaction pathway. This study strengthens our notion that exposure to indoor-related microbe damage increases the risk for systemic subclinical inflammation and creates a health risk for building users.

Is CCL18 a potential biomarker of type-2 asthma endotypes?	33287605	This exploratory cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the associations between the chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) blood level and phenotypic characteristics of asthma. In a sample of 173 asthmatic adult patients from the Cohort of Bronchial obstruction and Asthma (63.4% women; median age 50 ± interquartile range 27.5 years; median level of CCL18 was 44.1 ± interquartile range 27.5 ng/mL), a multivariate analysis found an association between the log-transformed value of blood CCL18 and age (+0.7% [0.1; 1.3] per 1-year increase, p = 0.033), gender (-25.1% [-42; -3.2] in women, p = 0.029), and nasal polyposis (+38.1% [11.6; 70.9], p = 0.004). No association was observed between CCL18 level and the other main phenotypic characteristics of asthma. In conclusion, our exploratory study suggests that CCL18 is not an effective biomarker of allergic asthma endotype but may rather be a biomarker of tissue eosinophilia as supported by its association with nasal polyposis.

Hydrogen Sulfide Attenuates Hyperhomocysteinemia-induced Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability by Inhibiting MMP-9.	33287606	Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is implicated in various neurovascular disorders including vascular dementia, subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke. Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels are associated with increased oxidative stress and compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently emerged as potent neuroprotective molecule in various neurological conditions including those associated with HHcy. The present study evaluates the protective effect of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS; a source of H2S) on HHcy-induced BBB dysfunction and underpin molecular mechanisms. Supplementation of NaHS restored the increased BBB permeability in the cortex and hippocampus of HHcy animals assessed in terms of diffused sodium fluorescein and Evans blue tracer dyes in the brain. Activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) assessed by gelatinase activity and in situ gelatinase assay was restored to the normal in the cortex and hippocampus of HHcy animals supplemented with NaHS. Furthermore, application of gelatin zymography revealed that specifically MMP-9 activity was increased in the cortex and hippocampus of HHcy animals, which was inhibited by NaHS supplementation. Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that NaHS administration also decreased mRNA expression of MMP-9 in the hippocampus of HHcy animals. NaHS supplementation was further observed to reduce water retention in the brain regions of Hcy treated animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that NaHS supplementation ameliorates HHcy-induced BBB permeability and brain edema by inhibiting the mRNA expression and activity of MMP-9. Therefore, H2S and H2S releasing drugs may be used as a novel therapeutic approach to treat HHcy-associated neurovascular disorders.	MMPs	 matrix metalloproteinases

Since there is still no specific treatment available, prevention of disease spread is crucial to manage the pandemic. Adequate public information is very important. To assess the optimal timing, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between web-based interest and new cases and deaths due to COVID-19.	COVID-19	 Corona Virus Disease 2019
Development of a Novel Multiplex Bead-based Assay for Measuring Autoantibodies on Flow Cytometric Platform.	33287608	Background: Autoantibodies (AAbs) are important biomarkers for the diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases (ADs). The detection of AAbs performed by current methods (indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)/Immunoblot (dot/line)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA) which have limitations in terms of performing multiple assays to arrive at laboratory diagnosis. We validated a novel multiplex bead-based assay (NMBA) that could quantify five common antibodies, simultaneously, on a flow-cytometry platform. Methods: A total of five recombinant antigens (SS-A Ro60, CENP B, RNP 70, Scl 70 and Histones) were covalently coupled onto beads and tested using known positive sera (positive for AAbs) and analyzed using flow cytometer. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were obtained for each antigen, analyzed by both assays (NMBA and IIFT). It showed comparable or higher values for the NMBA. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rho) were ≥ 0.97, (P < .05), indicating that multiplexing of the five autoantigens did not alter the results obtained when antigens were tested individually. The mean intra-assay precision measured by coefficient of variation (CV) was7.56 ± 1.6% and the mean inter-assay CV was 10.03 ± 1.34%. The time taken from sample receipt to reporting of results was 90 minutes in NMBA as compared to 150 minutes of IIFT Conclusion: The NMBA could quantitatively measure antibodies against five autoantigens, simultaneously in patient's sera. The assay is faster, objective, reproducible, requires low sample volume, and stable. Moreover, the flow cytometer in diagnostic laboratory settings for hematological and transplant immunology tests, can also be used for testing AAbs.	CV	 coefficient of variation

"""Association of APOE gene polymorphisms with primary open angle glaucoma in Brazilian patients""."	33287609	Background: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a multifactorial disease that affects 65.5 million people worldwide. In addition to the genetic variants already established as indicators of greater risk for POAG, the apolipoprotein (APOE) gene has been studied in some populations, with controversial results. The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency of the genetic variants of APOE in the Brazilian population, and to evaluate the association between these polymorphisms and the risk of POAG. Methods: APOE variants (rs429358; rs7412) were genotyped in 402 POAG patients and 401 controls. We evaluated the association between APOE genetic variants and the risk for POAG, as well as the correlation between the requirement of glaucoma surgery and the APOE polymorphisms. Results: Among the three APOE gene isoforms, we found a low frequency of APOE alleles ε2 (7.34%) and ε4 (11.76%), but a high frequency of ε3 (80.88%) in our population. When compared to ε3ε3 reference genotype, ε2 allele-carriers (OR = 1.516; p-value = 0.04) and ε2ε3 genotype (OR = 1.655; p-value = 0.02) were associated with a greater risk for POAG. An additive genetic model confirmed the influence of the ε2 allele in the risk of POAG in this sample of the Brazilian population (OR = 1.502; p-value = 0.04). There was no significant association between the analyzed genotypes and the requirement or number of glaucoma surgeries (p > .05). Conclusion: Brazilian individuals carrying the APOEε2 allele may be at an increased risk for the development of POAG.	APOE	 apolipoprotein

Purkinje cell (PC) antibody positivity in a patient with autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy.	33287611	Purpose: This case report is the first to describe the detection of antibodies against inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (ITPR1, I3PR) in a patient diagnosed with autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy. ITPR1 is known as one of the Purkinje cell antibodies present in autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA). Here, we described the association between autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy and autoimmune cerebellar disease (ACD). Materials and methods: Demographic features, clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and neuroimaging findings were collected from this patient. Specifically, antibodies against GFAP and other proteins associated with neurological disorders were measured by immunofluorescence staining in both serum and CSF samples. Results: A 52-year-old woman was diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis. She presented with cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric/behavioral abnormalities and serious insomnia with subacute onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral hyperintensity in the semioval centers on axial images and perivascular linear enhancement oriented radially to the ventricles on sagittal images. GFAP-IgG, oligoclonal bands (OBs), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-IgG and ITPR1-IgG coexisted in her CSF. She responded well to immunoglobulin and steroid treatments. Conclusion: Here, we describe the case of a patient with autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy whose CSF was positive for ITPR1-IgG; however, she did not show typical ataxia manifestations or cerebellar lesions on her MRI scan. This suggests that ITPR1-IgG is not pathogenic, and the positivity of this antibody in CSF is probably associated with the presence of autoimmune inflammation.	NMDAR)-IgG	 receptor

Purkinje cell (PC) antibody positivity in a patient with autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy.	33287611	Purpose: This case report is the first to describe the detection of antibodies against inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (ITPR1, I3PR) in a patient diagnosed with autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy. ITPR1 is known as one of the Purkinje cell antibodies present in autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA). Here, we described the association between autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy and autoimmune cerebellar disease (ACD). Materials and methods: Demographic features, clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and neuroimaging findings were collected from this patient. Specifically, antibodies against GFAP and other proteins associated with neurological disorders were measured by immunofluorescence staining in both serum and CSF samples. Results: A 52-year-old woman was diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis. She presented with cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric/behavioral abnormalities and serious insomnia with subacute onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral hyperintensity in the semioval centers on axial images and perivascular linear enhancement oriented radially to the ventricles on sagittal images. GFAP-IgG, oligoclonal bands (OBs), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-IgG and ITPR1-IgG coexisted in her CSF. She responded well to immunoglobulin and steroid treatments.

The need for new algorithms of treatment sequencing in clear-cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	33287612	"Introduction: In recent years, the systemic treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has undergone profound innovations, offering the availability of new drugs, and raising the bar of the survival expectation in this, previously, almost-always, incurable disease. The likeliness of reaching durable response and long-term survival is still closely linked to good clinical management and smart treatment sequencing, rather than to a single systemic treatment choice. Areas covered: We review all systemic therapeutic options currently available, describe the evidence behind the current options available for mRCC patient treatment and provide our personal cues to support clinical decisions. Expert opinion: The IMDC classification is still the only widely validated tool for the choice of primary therapy. Other elements should then be considered for selecting patients who can still receive TKI monotherapy (good risk patients) or who deserve an ""all-at-once"" approach with TKI plus ICI (poor risk patients with high metastatic burden and poor-prognosis organ involvement, likely not able to achieve a second chance), identifying these two ""extreme"" situations and setting all the other treatment choices on the basis of several nuances. In the second- and further-line setting, ad-hoc prospective trials are awaited."	mRCC	 metastatic renal cell carcinoma
Neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions induced by montelukast in children with asthma impair theirs quality of life.	33287615	Introduction: Montelukast-induced neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been reported in retrospective studies. This study aimed to reveal the neuropsychiatric ADRs triggered in patients taking montelukast due to asthma in real time, and to evaluate the effect of these ADRs on quality of life (QoL). Methods: Patients, ages 3-18 years, taking montelukast for the first time and their parents were included. Ages 3-7 years were defined as the preschool and ages 8 - 18 years as the school-age group. At the beginning of the study and at the end of the second week of treatment, the neuropsychiatric complaint assessment questionnaire and the KINDL QoL scale were administered to patients and their parents. The effect of ADRs on the decrease in QoL was evaluated by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Neuropsychiatric ADRs were reported in 78 (62.4%) of 125 patients, who recovered when the drug was discontinued. Temperamental behavior, nightmares and sleep disorders occurred significantly more often in both groups compared with pre-treatment (p < 0.001 for each). In both groups, except in the child-reported family relationships subscale in the school-age group, significant decreases were found in both child and parent proxy-reported QoL total/sub-scores compared with pre-treatment (p˂0.001 for each). It was found in the evaluation that the overall QoL of those experiencing ADRs in both age groups was more affected. (Child-reported QoL ORpre-school age=2.66, p = 0.048; ORschool-age=5.95, p = 0.027; parent-proxy QoL ORpre-school age =3.52, p = 0.010, ORschool-age=6.43, p = 0.027) Conclusions: Montelukast-induced neuropsychiatric ADRs are more frequent than reported in the literature and negatively impact children's QoL.

Menstrual variation in the acute testosterone and cortisol response to laboratory stressors correlate with baseline testosterone fluctuations at a within- and between-person level.	33287617	Studies have compared HPA and HPG stress reactivity across the follicular and luteal phases to assess the menstrual impact of estradiol and progesterone fluctuations. Ovulatory shifts in baseline and stressor-induced testosterone among athletic women offers a new framework to explore these responses. Here we investigated menstrual variation in baseline testosterone as a predictor of the acute testosterone and cortisol response to laboratory stressors in female athletes. Using a semi-randomized crossover design, thirty athletic women completed a physical (4 × 6-second bike sprints) and psychological (5 × 2-min cognitive tests with social evaluation) stressor on day seven (D7), 14 (D14), and 21 (D21) of a menstrual cycle. Baseline fluctuations and acute changes in salivary testosterone and cortisol were measured. The D14 testosterone response to both stressors (13.7%) exceeded D7 (7.3%) and D21 (7.0%), whereas cortisol was less responsive on D14 (9.8%) than D7 (13.0%) and D21 (12.0%); all moderate to large effect size differences (p < 0.01). Baseline testosterone, which presented large individual and menstrual variation with a D14 peak, was significantly related (moderate correlations) to testosterone and cortisol stress reactivity on a between-person level. Both outcomes were related (weak correlations) to within-person fluctuations in baseline testosterone, but these effects were mediated by testing day. In conclusion, menstrual variation in baseline testosterone concentration correlated with testosterone and cortisol reactivity to a physical and psychological stressor. Thus, gradients of stressor-induced hormonal change showed some dependency to endogenous testosterone, both individual differences and fluctuations over time, among naturally cycling athletic women. Lay summary: The female menstrual cycle is accompanied by dramatic shifts in estradiol and progesterone concentration, but less is known about testosterone variability and its role in stress regulation. In this study, menstrual fluctuations in baseline testosterone concentration correlated with acute testosterone and cortisol reactivity to laboratory stressors.	D21	 21

Severe anaphylactic shock after anesthesia induction: An unusual initial manifestation of Churg-Strauss syndrome.	33287613	Churg-Strauss syndrome or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitits (EGPA) is a rare multisystem disorder. A case of anaphylactic shock after induction of anesthesia, as the initial clinical presentation of Churg-Strauss syndrome in a 15-year-old girl is reported. It is extremely rare to see pediatric patients with previous perioperative anaphylaxis receiving future anesthesia; a multidisciplinary approach including allergist, rheumatologist, anesthesiologist, and surgeon is necessary in order to provide a better future anesthetic plan.

Health Care Transition in School-Based Health Centers: A Pilot Study.	33287619	Nationally, there are low rates of high school-age youth receiving health care transition (HCT) preparation from health care providers. This pilot study implemented and assessed the use of a structured HCT process, the Six Core Elements of HCT, in two school-based health centers (SBHCs) in Washington, DC. The pilot study examined the feasibility of incorporating the Six Core Elements into routine care and identified self-care skill gaps among students. Quality improvement methods were used to customize, implement, and measure the Six Core Elements and HCT supports. After the pilot, both SBHCs demonstrated improvement in their implementation of the structured HCT process. More than half of the pilot participants reported not knowing how to find their doctor's phone number and not knowing what a referral is. These findings indicate the need for incorporating HCT supports into SBHCs to help students build self-care skills necessary for adulthood.	SBHCs	 school-based health centers

Degradation of Phosalone By Silver Ion Catalytic Hydrolysis.	33287621	Pesticides application is expanding globally as the worldwide population increases demanding a secure and safe food supply. Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, as a group, are widely used because they are rapidly degraded in the environment and because they have excellent efficacy and an acceptable price point. However, the chemical fate of organophosphorus pesticides is influenced by several factors, including their chemistry in aquatic environments. Among many degradation choices, hydrolysis by metal ions appears to be a good approach. Dissolved metal ions have been shown to promote the hydrolysis of organophosphorus pesticides. Using silver ion, we showed the effectiveness under in vitro and in vivo conditions for this metal ion to decontaminate water polluted by the organophosphorus phosalone. Phosalone was completely degraded in the presence of silver ions in a mole ratio of 7 to 1 in 20 min. Rainbow trout were divided into experimental groups to investigate the most effective ratio of silver/phosalone for pesticide degradation. Silver ion (2%) at a concentration of 0.75 and 0.1 mL removed phosalone (2%) at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.5 mL. All the rainbow trout survived in these two groups. This experiment suggested that silver ions can be beneficial at ratios in the range of 1:4 to 1:6 by hydrolyzing phosalone by attacking the electron-deficient phosphorus atom in the pesticide.

Lactose hydrolysis using β-galactosidase from Kluyveromyces lactis immobilized with sodium alginate for potential industrial applications.	33287624	"The present study aimed to evaluate the lactose hydrolysis conditions from ""coalho"" cheese whey using β-galactosidase (β-gal) produced by Kluyveromyces lactis immobilized with sodium alginate. Three sodium alginate-based immobilization systems were evaluated (0.5, 0.7, and 1% w/v) for maximizing the immobilization yield (Y), efficiency (EM), and recovered activity (ar). The lactose hydrolysis capacity of the immobilized form of β-gal was determined, and simulated environments were used to assess the preservation of the immobilized enzyme in the gastrointestinal tract. The results showed that β-gal immobilization with 1% (w/v) sodium alginate presented the best results (EM of 66%, Y of 41%, and ar of 65%). The immobilization system maintained the highest pH stability in the range between 5.0 and 7.0, with the highest relative activity obtained under pH 5 conditions. The temperature stability was also favored by immobilization at 50 °C for 30 min was obtained a relative activity of 180.0 ± 1.37%. In 6 h, the immobilized β-gal was able to hydrolyze 46% of the initial lactose content. For the gastrointestinal simulations, around 40% of the activity was preserved after 2 h. Overall, the results described here are promising for the industrial applications of β-galactosidase from K. lactis."	ar	 recovered activity

Risk Factor Burden and Long-Term Prognosis of Patients With Premature Coronary Artery Disease.	33287625	Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is increasing among young adults. We aimed to describe the cardiovascular risk factors and long-term prognosis of premature CAD. Methods and Results Using the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease, we evaluated 3655 patients admitted between 1995 and 2013 with a first diagnosis of obstructive CAD before the age of 50 years. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization, were ascertained for up to 10 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess associations with the rate of first recurrent event, and negative binomial log-linear regression was used for rate of multiple event recurrences. Past or current smoking was the most frequent cardiovascular factor (60.8%), followed by hypertension (52.8%) and family history of CAD (39.8%). Within a 10-year follow-up, 52.9% of patients had at least 1 MACE, 18.6% had at least 2 recurrent MACEs, and 7.9% had at least 3 recurrent MACEs, with death occurring in 20.9% of patients. Across follow-up, 31.7% to 37.2% of patients continued smoking, 81.7% to 89.3% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels beyond the goal of 70 mg/dL, and 16% had new-onset diabetes mellitus. Female sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, multivessel disease, and chronic inflammatory disease were factors associated with recurrent MACEs. Conclusions Premature CAD is an aggressive disease with frequent ischemic recurrences and premature death. Individuals with premature CAD have a high proportion of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, but failure to control them is frequently observed.	MACEs	 Major adverse cardiovascular events

Risk Factors for Polyvascular Involvement in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.	33287626	Background Atherosclerosis in >1 vascular bed (ie, polyvascular disease), often a feature of peripheral artery disease (PAD), is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We sought to identify risk factors for polyvascular involvement in patients with PAD. Methods and Results We performed 2-sample Mendelian randomization using an inverse-variance-weighted approach, to assess 60 exposures including size and lipid content of atherogenic lipoproteins, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and smoking as causal mediators for polyvascular disease in patients with PAD. Genetic instruments for these exposures were obtained from prior genome-wide association studies. Patients with PAD were from the Mayo Vascular Disease Biorepository, and polyvascular disease (ie, concomitant coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and/or abdominal aortic aneurysm) was ascertained by validated phenotyping algorithms. Of 3279 patients with PAD, 61% had polyvascular disease. Genetically predicted levels of the lipid content and/or particle measures of very small and small size very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, and large low-density lipoprotein were associated with polyvascular disease: odds ratios (OR) of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.23-2.61), 1.70 (95% CI, 1.17-2.61), and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.09-1.80) per 1 SD increase in genetically determined levels, respectively. Both genetically predicted diastolic and systolic blood pressure were associated with polyvascular disease; OR per 10 mm Hg genetic increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure were 1.66 (95% CI, 1.19-2.33) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.07-1.60), respectively. Conclusions Lifetime exposure to increased lipid content and levels of very small and small very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, and large low-density lipoprotein particles as well as elevated blood pressure are associated with polyvascular involvement in patients with PAD. Reduction in levels of such exposures may limit progression of atherosclerosis in patients with PAD.	OR	 odds ratios
Risk Factors for Polyvascular Involvement in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.	33287626	Background Atherosclerosis in >1 vascular bed (ie, polyvascular disease), often a feature of peripheral artery disease (PAD), is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We sought to identify risk factors for polyvascular involvement in patients with PAD. Methods and Results We performed 2-sample Mendelian randomization using an inverse-variance-weighted approach, to assess 60 exposures including size and lipid content of atherogenic lipoproteins, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and smoking as causal mediators for polyvascular disease in patients with PAD. Genetic instruments for these exposures were obtained from prior genome-wide association studies. Patients with PAD were from the Mayo Vascular Disease Biorepository, and polyvascular disease (ie, concomitant coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and/or abdominal aortic aneurysm) was ascertained by validated phenotyping algorithms. Of 3279 patients with PAD, 61% had polyvascular disease. Genetically predicted levels of the lipid content and/or particle measures of very small and small size very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, and large low-density lipoprotein were associated with polyvascular disease: odds ratios (OR) of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.23-2.61), 1.70 (95% CI, 1.17-2.61), and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.09-1.80) per 1 SD increase in genetically determined levels, respectively.

Near full-length Genomic Characterization of 16 HIV-1 CRF01_AE Primary Isolates from Guangxi, China.	33287627	Isolation and culture of HIV is an important basis for AIDS etiology, immunolo-gy, drug screening, clinical treatment, and vaccine research. CRF01_AE is one of the predominant strains of HIV-1 in China. However, there are few HIV-1 CRF01_AE isolates that have been reported. In this study, sixteen HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains from Guangxi, China were isolated, the nearly full-length genomes were reverse transcribed and amplified in two halves with the 1-kb overlapping region. The PCR products were sequenced directly. The phylogenetic analysis results showed that all of the sixteen isolated strains were CRF01_AE recombinant form, and two clusters were set up in the phylogenetic tree. The tropic prediction of 16 strains showed that two isolates were CCR5 tropic, and the others are CXCR4 tropic. Eight of the isolated strains are drug-resistant according to the genetic prediction. These 16 near full-length char-acterized CRF01_AE isolates obtained in this study will provide valuable genomic and phenotypic information on HIV-1 strains circulating in China for related re-searches.

Assessable learning outcomes for the EU Education and Training Framework core and Function A specific modules: Report of an ETPLAS WORKING Group.	33287628	Article 23(2) of the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU, which regulates welfare provisions for animals used for scientific purposes, requires that staff involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes be adequately educated and trained before they undertake any such work. However, the nature and extent of such training is not stipulated in the Directive. To facilitate Member States in fulfilling their education and training obligations, the European Commission developed a common Education and Training Framework, which was endorsed by the Member States Competent Authorities. An Education & Training Platform for Laboratory Animal Science (ETPLAS) Working Group was recently established to develop further guidance to the Learning Outcomes in the Framework, with the objective to clarify the levels of knowledge and understanding required by trainees, and to provide the criteria by which these Learning Outcomes should be assessed. Using the Framework document as a starting point, assessment criteria for the Learning Outcomes of the modules required for Function A persons (carrying out procedures on animals) for rats, mice and zebrafish were created with sufficient detail to enable trainees, providers and assessors to appreciate the level of knowledge, understanding and skills required to pass each module. Adoption and utilization of this document by training providers and accrediting or approving bodies will harmonize introductory education and training for those involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes within the European Union, promote mutual recognition of training within and between Member States and therefore free movement of personnel.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Neuroblastoma: exploring crosstalk and therapeutic implications.	33287630	Neuroblastoma (NB) is the second most common solid cancer in childhood, accounting for 15% of cancer-related deaths in children. In high-risk neuroblastoma patients, the majority suffers from metastasis. Despite intensive multimodal treatment, long-term survival remains less than 40%. The bone marrow (BM) is among the most common sites of distant metastasis in patients with high-risk NB. In this environment, small populations of tumor cells can persist after treatment (minimal residual disease, MRD) and induce relapse. Therapy resistance of these residual tumor cells in BM remains a major obstacle for the cure of NB. A detailed understanding of the microenvironment and its role in tumor progression is of utmost importance for improving the treatment efficiency of NB. In BM, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) constitute an important part of the microenvironment, where they support hematopoiesis and modulate immune responses. Their role in tumor progression is not completely understood, especially for NB. While on the one hand MSCs have been found to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor growth and metastasis and to induce chemoresistance, some reports point towards a tumor-suppressive effect of MSCs. In this review we aim to compile current knowledge about the role of MSCs in NB development and progression. We evaluate arguments that depict tumor-supportive versus -suppressive properties of MSCs in the context of NB and give an overview of factors involved in MSC-NB crosstalk. A focus lies on the BM as a metastatic niche, since that is the predominant site for NB metastasis and relapse. Finally, we will present opportunities and challenges for therapeutic targeting of MSCs in the BM microenvironment.	EMT	 epithelial-mesenchymal transition

Near full-length genomic characterization of a novel HIV-1 B/C recombinant form identified in Guangdong Province, China.	33287631	The wide variety of new HIV-1 recombinant variants are a predominant challenge for understanding the molecular epidemiology and preventing the spread of the HIV-1 epidemic. Here, we confirmed a novel HIV-1 unique B/C recombinant (ZLQ01186) isolated from a male patient infected with HIV-1 through injection drug use in Foshan city, Guangdong Province. The near full-length genome was amplified, and then the PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The genomic sequence of the strain, with two subtype B segements inserted into the subtype C backbone, was 8953 bp in length, extending from 647 to 9599 bp according to the HXB2 genome. Additionally, this B/C recombinant strain contained the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation K103N and the integrase strand transfer inhibitor other resistance mutation L74I according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database program. The drug resistance profile indicates high-level resistance against efavirenz and rilpivirine. This study identified a recombinant between the main circulating strains, indicating a more complicated trend of the HIV-1 epidemic in Guangdong, China.	ĠHIV	 strand transfer

Optimization of reaction time for detection of organophosphorus pesticides by enzymatic inhibition assay and mathematical modeling of enzyme inhibition.	33287632	Enzyme inhibition assay was used as a biomarker for detection of organophosphates pesticides in food and environmental samples. The aim of the present study was to optimize the time of enzyme-inhibitor reaction for quantitative determination of fenitrothion organophosphate based on cholinesterase inhibition. The results showed that this method provides a time-efficient, best linearity and simple assay. The effect of reaction time on the linearity relationship of the noncompetitive inhibition equation was studied. The best linearity of the assay was found at an optimum reaction time of 3.0 min, with coefficient of determination r 2 of 0.9972, in the range of inhibitor concentrations from 0.016 to 2.0 μg mL-1. The enzyme inhibition reached a plateau at 5 min by addition of pesticide in vitro and then the inhibited enzyme reactivate spontaneously and approached steady state at 20 min. A theoretical kinetic model to explain the effect of reaction time on the enzyme inhibition by addition of pesticide in vitro was derived. The higher values of coefficient of determination r 2 for the predicted model and error functions of the minimum deviations suggest that this model can be used to represent the experimental data and explain the plasma cholinesterase inhibition by fenitrothion pesticide.

Genetic characteristics of three unique recombinant forms of HIV-1 in Yunnan, China.	33287633	To explore the molecular epidemiological status of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Yunnan, China, three HIV-1 near-full-length genomes were amplified and sequenced from plasma samples that were collected from Burmese patients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 in Dehong Prefecture in Yunnan Province in 2017. Phylogenetic and bootscanning analyses revealed that all the sequences might be HIV-1 second-generation recombinant forms of circulating recombinant forms (CRF07_BC and CRF83_cpx) and unique recombinant forms. One of the sequences contained six CRF01_AE fragments, five subtype C fragments and two subtype B fragments, which were separated by 12 breakpoints. These results revealed that the second-generation recombination of HIV-1within different strains is still ongoing in Deheong, China. Systematic surveys and immediate interventions are urgently needed to prevent the formation of increasingly complex HIV-1 recombinant forms.	HIV-1	 human immunodeficiency virus type 1
Improved hand prostheses control for transradial amputees based on hybrid of voice recognition and electromyography.	33287634	The control of prostheses and their complexities is one of the greatest challenges limiting wide amputees' use of upper limb prostheses. The main challenges include the difficulty of extracting signals for controlling the prostheses, limited number of degrees of freedom (DoF), and cost-prohibitive for complex controlling systems. In this study, a real-time hybrid control system, based on electromyography (EMG) and voice commands (VC) is designed to render the prosthesis more dexterous with the ability to accomplish amputee's daily activities proficiently. The voice and EMG systems were combined in three proposed hybrid strategies, each strategy had different number of movements depending on the combination protocol between voice and EMG control systems. Furthermore, the designed control system might serve a large number of amputees with different amputation levels, and since it has a reasonable cost and be easy to use. The performance of the proposed control system, based on hybrid strategies, was tested by intact-limbed and amputee participants for controlling the HANDi hand. The results showed that the proposed hybrid control system was robust, feasible, with an accuracy of 94%, 98%, and 99% for Strategies 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It was possible to specify the grip force applied to the prosthetic hand within three gripping forces. The amputees participated in this study preferred combination Strategy 3 where the voice and EMG are working concurrently, with an accuracy of 99%.	VC	 voice commands

Characterization of HIV-1 Envelope V3 Region Sequences from Virologically Controlled HIV-Infected Older Patients on Long Term Antiretroviral Therapy.	33287636	While many HIV-infected patients have attained older age due to the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in controlling viremia and increasing CD4 T-cell counts, HIV continues to persist in several target cells. We have characterized 514 HIV-1 envelope V3 region sequences (94-96 amino acids) from 25 HIV-infected older patients' PBMC DNA on long-term ART with controlled viremia (undetectable viral load) and improved CD4 T-cell counts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the V3 region sequences of each patient formed distinct clusters that were well separated and discriminated from other patients' sequences. The coding potential of the V3 region, including several patient-specific amino acid motifs and functional domains, including the 2 cysteines sandwiching the V3 loop, the central GPGR motif with variation at 1 position in some sequences, the base GDIR motif, and the N-glycosylation sites were generally conserved. The patients' V3 region sequences contained amino acid motifs conferring affinity mostly for CCR5 coreceptor, suggesting R5 phenotype. There was a low degree of heterogeneity and lower estimates of genetic diversity in all 25 patients' V3 region sequences. Twelve out of 25 patients' V3 region sequences were found to be under positive selection pressure. Analysis of the several cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes showed variation, whereas some of known neutralizing antibodies (nAb) epitopes showed conservation in patients' V3 region sequences. In conclusion, a low degree of genetic variability and maintenance of functional domains with R5 phenotypes, and variation in CTL and conservation of nAb epitopes were the hallmarks of V3 region sequences from our 25 virologically controlled HIV-infected older patients on long-term ART.	nAb	 neutralizing antibodies

Design and Assessment of Novel Anti-CD30 CARs with Human Antigen-recognition Domains.	33287637	Chimeric antigen receptors are artificial fusion proteins that incorporate antigen-recognition domains and T-cell signaling domains. CD30 is a cell-surface protein expressed on Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), some T-cell lymphomas, and some B-cell lymphomas. CD30 has a restricted expression pattern in normal cells, so CD30 has good potential as a clinical target for CAR T cells. We compared 3 different anti-CD30 CAR designs incorporating a single-chain variable fragment derived from the 5F11 fully-human monoclonal antibody. 5F11-28Z has hinge, transmembrane, and costimulatory domains from CD28 and a CD3-zeta. T-cell activation domain. 5F11-CD828Z has hinge and transmembrane domains from CD8-alpha, a CD28 costimulatory domain, and a CD3-zeta T-cell activation domain. 5F11-CD8BBZ is identical to 5F11-CD828Z except for the replacement of the CD28 moiety with a 4-1BB moiety. We found that T cells expressing 5F11-CD8BBZ had lower levels of CD30-specific degranulation and cytokine release compared with CD28-containing CARs. When compared to the CD28-containing CARs, T cells expressing 5F11-CD8BBZ had higher levels of nonspecific functional activity including degranulation, cytokine release, and proliferation when stimulated with CD30-negative target cells. We established tumors in nod-scid common gamma-chain (NSG) mice and treated the tumors with T cells expressing different CARs. T cells expressing 5F11-28Z were most effective at eradicating tumors. T cells expressing 5F11-CD828Z had intermediate effectiveness, and T cells expressing 5F11-CD8BBZ were least effective. CD30+ T cells are lost from cultures of T cells containing 5F11-28Z-expressing T cells. This indicated the killing of CD30+ T cells by the 5F11-28Z-expressing T cells. Despite this, the number of T cells in the cultures consistently accumulated to numbers needed for use in a clinical trial. Based on all in vitro and murine experiments comparing the different CARs, we selected 5F11-28Z for further development, and we have initiated a clinical trial testing 5F11-28Z T cells.

Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to heifer fertility in Hanwoo (Korean cattle).	33287639	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have accelerated the identification of functional trait loci in cattle and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes associated with fertility and production traits in high milk yield dairy cattle. The fertility of Hanwoo (Korean native beef cattle) has declined after the adaptation of a selection program for high quantity and quality meat. However, there are few GWAS studies of fertility in beef cattle. We performed a genome-wide association study of 40 Korean native beef cattle heifers with imputed 770 K genotype and identified 12 significant SNPs within seven regions on three chromosomes (BTA 8, BTA 16 and BTA 24) associated with services per conception (SPC). Five SNPs were located in the ABCA1, BRINP3 and ESRRG genes, which are involved in early embryo development. In addition, 27 proximal genes were identified within 1 Mb of the candidate SNPs, which are involved in muscle cell differentiation and muscle structure development. However, we did not find any previously reported SNPs related to fertility in Holstein cows. Taken together, we identified SNPs associated with SPC and their proximal genes using gene-based analysis and the candidates were different from SNPs associated with subfertility of dairy cattle.

The Experience of Working With a Faith Community Nurse Liaison of Care in a Primary Care Practice Among Older Adult Clients and Their Informal Caregiver.	33287641	Informal caregivers of older adults aging in place are at risk for adverse health and financial consequences. This descriptive qualitative study explored the experience of working with a faith community nurse (FCN) liaison of care in a Catholic health care system affiliated primary care practice among older adult clients and their informal caregiver. Semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with nine older adult client-informal caregiver dyads, three clients, and one caregiver (n = 22). Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis method. The analysis generated one overarching theme, I'm Sorry the Study and FCN Visits Are Coming to an End, and two key themes, The FCN Was Always There to Help Us (older adult clients) and The FCN Took the Pressure Off of Caregiving for Awhile (informal caregivers). Participants viewed the FCN as an instrumental member of their health care team and considered prayer and spiritual support offered by the FCN an essential element of care.	FCN	 faith community nurse
Associations of Observational and Genetically Determined Caffeine Intake With Coronary Artery Disease and Diabetes Mellitus.	33287642	Background Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant and is associated with lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether these associations are causal remains unknown. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with caffeine intake, and to investigate evidence for causal links with CAD or T2DM. In addition, we aimed to replicate previous observational findings. Methods and Results Observational associations were tested within UK Biobank using Cox regression analyses. Moderate observational caffeine intakes from coffee or tea were associated with lower risks of CAD or T2DM, with the lowest risks at intakes of 121 to 180 mg/day from coffee for CAD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.82; P<1×10-16]), and 301 to 360 mg/day for T2DM (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.67-0.86]; P=1.57×10-5). Next, genome-wide association studies were performed on self-reported caffeine intake from coffee, tea, or both in 407 072 UK Biobank participants. These analyses identified 51 novel genetic variants associated with caffeine intake at P<1.67×10-8. These loci were enriched for central nervous system genes. However, in contrast to the observational analyses, 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses using the identified loci in independent disease-specific cohorts yielded no evidence for causal links between genetically determined caffeine intake and the development of CAD or T2DM. Conclusions Mendelian randomization analyses indicate genetically determined higher caffeine intake might not protect against CAD or T2DM, despite protective associations in observational analyses.

Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of three [14C]PBDE congeners in laying hens and transfer to eggs.	33287643	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) levels in environmental matrices have generally declined following their phaseout as flame retardants. The objective of this study was to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of three persistent PBDEs in laying hens and their transfer into eggs. Laying hens (n = 4 per congener) received a single oral dose of BDE-99, -153, or -209 and eggs and excreta were collected daily for 7 days, then tissues were collected and analysed. Cumulative BDE-209 excretion was 93% of dose, and bioavailability was approximately 17%. Lesser amounts of BDE-99 (41%) and -153 (26%) were excreted with bioavailabilities of 87% and 79%, respectively. Phenolic metabolites were observed in excreta extracts from BDE-99 dosed birds. Cumulative transfers based on bioavailability of BDE-99, -153, and -209 to eggs were 17%, 34%, and 15%, respectively. Egg residues were primarily present in yolk (12.3%, 23.5%, and 2.1% of the total dose for BDE-99, -153, and -209, respectively). Adipose, skin, ova, intestine, and thigh muscle contained the highest levels of radioactive tissue residues. These studies demonstrate movement of PBDE residues into edible tissues and eggs of laying hens.	PBDEs	 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers
In vitro performance of 3D printed PCL-β-TCP degradable spinal fusion cage.	33287645	Spinal fusion cages are commonly used to treat spinal diseases caused by degenerative changes, deformities, and trauma. At present, most of the main clinical spinal fusion cage products are non-degradable and still cause some undesirable side effects, such as the stress shielding phenomenon, interference with postoperative medical imaging, and obvious foreign body sensation in patients. Degradable spinal fusion cages have promising potential with extensive perspectives. The purpose of this study was to fabricate a degradable spinal fusion cage from both polycaprolactone (PCL) and high-proportion beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), using the highly personalised, accurate, and rapid fused deposition modelling 3 D printing technology. PCL and β-TCP were mixed in three different ratios (60:40, 55:45, and 50:50). Both in vitro degradation and cell experiments proved that all cages with the different PCL:β-TCP ratios met the mechanical properties of human cancellous bone while maintaining their structural integrity. The biological activity of the cages improved with higher amounts of the β-TCP content. This study also showed that a spinal fusion cage with high β-TCP content and suitable mechanical properties can be manufactured using extruding rods and appropriate models, providing a new solution for the design of degradable spinal fusion cages.

Citric acid coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated with lactoferrin for targeted negative MR imaging of glioma.	33287646	The proposed study was to develop the preparation of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIONs) modified with citric acid, with surface conjugated with lactoferrin (Lf), which used as a potential targeted contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain glioma. USPIONs were prepared by the thermal decomposition method. The hydrophobic USPIONs were coated with citric acid by the ligand exchange method. Then, Lf was conjugated into the surface of USPIONs. The obtained Lf-USPIONs were analyzed by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The size, size distribution, shape and superparamagnetic property of Lf-USPIONs were investigated with TEM and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Both FTIR and electrophoresis analysis demonstrated the successful conjugation of Lf to the surface of USPIONs. The average size of Lf-USPIONs was about 8.4 ± 0.5 nm, which was determined using the statistics of measured over 100 nanoparticles in the TEM image, with a negative charge of -7.3 ± 0.2 mV. TEM imaging revealed that Lf-USPIONs were good in dispersion and polygonal in morphology. VSM results indicated that Lf-USPIONs were superparamagnetic and the saturated magnetic intensity was about 69.8 emu/g. The Lf-USPIONs also showed good biocompatibility in hemolysis, cytotoxicity, cell migration and blood biochemistry studies. MR imaging results in vitro and in vivo indicated that Lf-USPIONs exhibited good negative contrast enhancement. Taken together, Lf-USPIONs hold great potential for brain gliomas MR imaging as a nanosized targeted contrast agent.	VSM	 vibrating sample magnetometer

The Impact of Positive School Climate on Suicidality and Mental Health Among LGBTQ Adolescents: A Systematic Review.	33287652	Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents are more likely to report suicidality and worse mental health than their heterosexual peers. We conducted a systematic review to examine the relationship between positive school climate and suicidality and mental health among LGBTQ adolescents. We searched the literature using PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Six studies met inclusion criteria, and all had low to moderate risks of bias. Results indicate that LGBTQ students in schools with more positive school climates were at lower risk of suicidality and reported fewer depressive symptoms compared to students in less positive school climates. Being at the forefront of health in schools, school nurses have the opportunity to advocate for changes in school environments that promote positive mental health for all youth, including LGBTQ adolescents.

CTNNB1 Knockdown Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Aldosterone Secretion Through Inhibiting Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in H295R Cells.	33287648	Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA) is one of the causative factors of primary aldosteronism. Previous studies have suggested that there are somatic CTNNB1 mutations in APA, but the specific mechanism of CTNNB1 mutation in APA tumorigenesis and aldosterone secretion remains unclear. In the present study, human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line H295 R was used to establish stable CTNNB1 knockdown cell lines. Cell proliferation and aldosterone secretion of H295 R cells in response to angiotensin Ⅱ (Agn Ⅱ) were analyzed. We found that CTNNB1 knockdown reduced β-catenin expression and inhibited proliferation of H295 R cells. CTNNB1 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and downregulated expression of downstream genes including axin 2, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), and cyclin D1. In addition, CTNNB1 knockdown decreased responses of H295 R cells to Agn Ⅱ and decreased aldosterone secretion. Our findings suggest that CTNNB1 knockdown can inhibit H295 R cell proliferation and decrease aldosterone secretion in the responses of H295 R cells to Ang II through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, indicating that targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be an important approach to decrease aldosterone secretion in the treatment of aldoster-producing adenomas.

The association between perceptual-cognitive processes and response time in decision making in young soccer players.	33287653	In soccer, it is relevant to understand the roles of Systems 1 (intuitive) and 2 (deliberative) in perceptual-cognitive processes and how they influence response time when making decisions. The aim of this study was to analyse how response time in decision making managed by Systems 1 and 2 is associated to the perceptual-cognitive processes of young soccer players. Ninety young soccer players participated. Perceptual-cognitive processes were assessed through visual search strategies, cognitive effort, and verbal reports. Participants wore a mobile-eye tracking system while viewing 11-a-side match play video-based soccer simulations. Response time in decision making was used to create two sub-groups: faster and slower decision-makers. Results indicated that players with faster response time in decision making employed more fixations of shorter duration, displayed less cognitive effort, as well as a greater number of thought processes associated with planning. These results reinforce that there are differences in the way of using the perceptive-cognitive processes from the priority system in the decision-making process. It is concluded that faster decision making, managed by System 1, implies greater ability to employ visual search strategies and to process information, thus enabling increased cognitive efficiency.

A Workflow for the Performance of the Differential Ovarian Follicle Count Using Deep Neuronal Networks.	33287654	In order to automate the counting of ovarian follicles required in multigeneration reproductive studies performed in the rat according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines 443 and 416, the application of deep neural networks was tested. The manual evaluation of the differential ovarian follicle count is a tedious and time-consuming task that requires highly trained personnel. In this regard, deep learning outputs provide overlay pictures for a more detailed documentation, together with an increased reproducibility of the counts. To facilitate the planned good laboratory practice (GLP) validation a workflow was set up using MLFlow to make all steps from generating of scans, training of the neural network, uploading of study images to the neural network, generation and storage of the results in a compliant manner controllable and reproducible. PyTorch was used as main framework to build the Faster region-based convolutional neural network for the training. We compared the performances of different depths of ResNet models with specific regard to the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of the models. In this paper, we describe all steps from data labeling, training of networks, and the performance metrics chosen to evaluate different network architectures.

Corneal Dystrophy in Dutch Belted Rabbits as a Possible Model of Thiel-Behnke Subtype of Epithelial-Stromal TGFβ-Induced Corneal Dystrophy.	33287658	The International Committee for Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) categorized corneal dystrophies in humans using anatomic, genotypic, and clinicopathologic phenotypic features. Relative to the IC3D classification, a review of the veterinary literature confirmed that corneal dystrophy is imprecisely applied to any corneal opacity and to multiple poorly characterized histologic abnormalities of the cornea in animals. True corneal dystrophy occurs in mice with targeted mutations and spontaneously in pet dogs and cats and in Dutch belted (DB) rabbits, but these instances lack complete phenotyping or genotyping. Corneal dystrophy in DB rabbits can be an important confounding finding in ocular toxicology studies but has only been described once. Therefore, the ophthalmology and pathology of corneal dystrophy in 13 DB rabbits were characterized to determine whether the findings were consistent with or a possible model of any corneal dystrophy subtypes in humans. Slit lamp and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging were used to characterize corneal dystrophy over 4 months in young DB rabbits. The hyperechoic OCT changes correlated with light microscopic findings in the anterior stroma, consisting of highly disordered collagen fibers and enlarged keratocytes. Histochemical stains did not reveal abnormal deposits. Small clusters of 8 to 16 nm diameter curly fibers identified by transmission electron microscopy were consistent with Thiel-Behnke (TBCD) subtype of epithelial-stromal transforming growth factor β-induced dystrophies. Sporadic corneal dystrophy in DB rabbits appears to be a potential animal model of TBCD, but genotypic characterization will be required to confirm this categorization.

The Impact of Experimentally Induced Limb Ischemia on the Rubber Hand Illusion.	33287660	The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a perceptual illusion in which one experiences an object as part of their body when synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation is applied to one's hand and the object. There are a variety of factors that can impact the occurrence of the RHI. In the present study, we demonstrate that experimentally induced peripheral ischemia can impact the RHI, namely it can result in larger alterations to the perceived position of one's hand. This study suggests that alterations to the cardiovascular system may be a source of individual differences in the RHI literature. Future studies with samples of individuals with cardiovascular pathology are recommended.	RHI	 rubber hand illusion
Tumor Vessel Normalization: A Window to Enhancing Cancer Immunotherapy.	33287656	Hostile microenvironment produced by abnormal blood vessels, which is characterized by hypoxia, low pH value and increasing interstitial fluid pressure, would facilitate tumor progression, metastasis, immunosuppression and anticancer treatments resistance. These abnormalities are the result of the imbalance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors (such as VEGF and angiopoietin 2, ANG2). Prudent use of anti-angiogenesis drugs would normalize these aberrant tumor vessels, resulting in a transient window of vessel normalization. In addition, use of cancer immunotherapy including immune checkpoint blockers when vessel normalization is achieved brings better outcomes. In this review, we sum up the advances in the field of understanding and application of the concept of tumor vessels normalization window to treat cancer. Moreover, we also outline some challenges and opportunities ahead to optimize the combination of anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapy, leading to improve patients' outcomes.	ĠANG2	 angiopoietin 2
Using Artificial Intelligence to Detect, Classify, and Objectively Score Severity of Rodent Cardiomyopathy.	33287662	Rodent progressive cardiomyopathy (PCM) encompasses a constellation of microscopic findings commonly seen as a spontaneous background change in rat and mouse hearts. Primary histologic features of PCM include varying degrees of cardiomyocyte degeneration/necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, and fibrosis. Mineralization can also occur. Cardiotoxicity may increase the incidence and severity of PCM, and toxicity-related morphologic changes can overlap with those of PCM. Consequently, sensitive and consistent detection and quantification of PCM features are needed to help differentiate spontaneous from test article-related findings. To address this, we developed a computer-assisted image analysis algorithm, facilitated by a fully convolutional network deep learning technique, to detect and quantify the microscopic features of PCM (degeneration/necrosis, fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, mineralization) in rat heart histologic sections. The trained algorithm achieved high values for accuracy, intersection over union, and dice coefficient for each feature. Further, there was a strong positive correlation between the percentage area of the heart predicted to have PCM lesions by the algorithm and the median severity grade assigned by a panel of veterinary toxicologic pathologists following light microscopic evaluation. By providing objective and sensitive quantification of the microscopic features of PCM, deep learning algorithms could assist pathologists in discerning cardiotoxicity-associated changes.

Using Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Algorithms to Verify N-Nitroso-N-Methylurea and Urethane Positive Control Proliferative Changes in Tg-RasH2 Mouse Carcinogenicity Studies.	33287665	In Tg-rasH2 carcinogenicity mouse models, a positive control group is treated with a carcinogen such as urethane or N-nitroso-N-methylurea to test study validity based on the presence of the expected proliferative lesions in the transgenic mice. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence-based deep learning (DL) could provide decision support for the toxicologic pathologist by screening for the proliferative changes, verifying the expected pattern for the positive control groups. Whole slide images (WSIs) of the lungs, thymus, and stomach from positive control groups were used for supervised training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). A single pathologist annotated WSIs of normal and abnormal tissue regions for training the CNN-based supervised classifier using INHAND criteria. The algorithm was evaluated using a subset of tissue regions that were not used for training and then additional tissues were evaluated blindly by 2 independent pathologists. A binary output (proliferative classes present or not) from the pathologists was compared to that of the CNN classifier. The CNN model grouped proliferative lesion positive and negative animals at high concordance with the pathologists. This process simulated a workflow for review of these studies, whereby a DL algorithm could provide decision support for the pathologists in a nonclinical study.	CNN	 convolutional neural network

Investigation of low temperature performances of hybrid catalysts with different chain length OHC reductants.	33287668	In the present work, NOx conversion efficiency of the hybrid catalysts at low temperatures was investigated. ANP-TVM and ANP-TVC-TVM hybrid catalysts for OHC-SCR performance were prepared by impregnation method. The properties of catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzes. The NOx conversion ratios with real diesel exhaust gases were performed using oxygenated hydrocarbon reductants such as ethanol, propanol, n-butanol and n-penthanol. Performances of the hybrid catalysts at different engine loads and low temperatures were investigated. It was determined that ANP-TVC-TVM gave better results at all temperatures and loads. In general, the performance of ANP-TVC-TVM hybrid catalyst was superior with ethanol reductant except for at 1 kW engine load. The maximum NOx conversion ratio was 90.6 % on the ANP-TVC-TVM hybrid catalyst with n-butanol at 1 kW engine load and 300 oC.	BET	 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller

The Effect of Female Economic Empowerment Interventions on the Risk of Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	33287669	Women's economic empowerment is an essential component of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Not only is it an end in itself but it has further been promoted for its potential to create positive externalities, including the reduction of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, the link between economic empowerment and the risk of IPV remains theoretically ambiguous. Marital dependency theory predicts that women with more financial resources hold higher bargaining power and are in a better position to leave potentially abusive relationships. Conversely, Resource theory posits that an increase in women's financial resources may clash with traditional gender roles, which may prompt their partner to reassert their status through violent means. In light of this debate, we conducted a meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of economic empowerment interventions on IPV. Based on a total sample size of 44,772 participants and robust variance estimation, our meta-analysis shows that women's economic empowerment was associated with a significant reduction in the pooled measure of emotional, sexual, and physical IPV. We further documented tentative evidence suggesting that these effects may be amplified when additional gender sensitization training is included in such programs. Despite the overall positive effects, some included studies reported increases in IPV, primarily in the form of partners exerting controlling behavior and dominance over financial resources. Our results therefore emphasize a need to prioritize women's safety in the process of designing economic empowerment programs and to closely monitor the potential risk of conflict and violence within beneficiaries' households.

Hidden healthcare populations: using intersectionality to theorise the experiences of LGBT+ people in Nigeria, Africa.	33287671	Minority population groups are often excluded or marginalised within health systems and in health research and policy. This article argues that theories of intersectionality can help us to understand these issues and develops the concept of 'hidden healthcare populations' - using the case of people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Plus (LGBT+) in Nigeria, in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings present original qualitative data from a seldom heard population group about instances of abuse, rejection and marginalisation by healthcare providers working in public and private healthcare facilities, and the attempts of LGBT+ people to resist and survive in that context. We extend theoretical understandings of intersectionality in global public health and explore how the concept relates to the social determinants of health. The article has significant implications for policy and healthcare education and responds to a call from the World Health Organisation to generate context-specific data to guide interventions targeted at minority population groups. Additionally, our discussion has wider significance because it highlights the Western-centric nature of much theory in health policy - and offers analysis and reinterpretation that incorporates queer, postcolonial, African perspectives.

The lived experiences of work and health of people living with deaf-blindness due to Usher syndrome type 2.	33287675	Purpose: This study aimed to explore lived experiences with working life from the perspective of people with deafblindness due to Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2). Background: A limited number of studies have explored working life of people with Usher syndrome. One study of individuals with USH2 showed that work active reported significantly better psychological health compared to non-working individuals. Methods: Seven participants aged 38-50 years with USH2 participated in interviews analysed by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: The analyses yielded four themes showing that work is a source of satisfaction and a commitment that needs to be balanced. It is also associated with facing limitations and feelings of uncertainty. Conclusion: Based on the psychology of work model we have demonstrated that work is associated with social connectedness, self-determination and a source of improved health outcomes. There are however also potential health hazards in people with USH2, indicating a need for balance between individual needs and resources, and an adapted environment, for maintaining or regaining health for actively working people with USH2.

B4GalT1 Regulates Apoptosis and Autophagy of Glioblastoma In Vitro and In Vivo.	33287670	Our study was designed to investigate the role of B4GalT1 in glioblastoma, in vitro and in vivo, to detect whether B4GalT1 knockdown could regulate the development of glioblastoma, and further observe the relationship between B4GalT1 knockdown and the apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma. To begin, we looked at TCGA and GEPIA systems to predict the potential function of B4GalT1. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression, or mRNA level, of B4GalT1 at different tissue or cell lines. Next, the occurrence and development of glioblastoma, in vitro and in vivo, was observed by using B4GalT1 knocked down by lentivirus. Finally, the apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma was observed in vitro and in vivo. Results show that B4GalT1 was a highly variable gene, and GEPIA and TCGA systems show B4GalT1 expression in GBM tumor tissue was higher than in normal tissue. Pair-wise gene correlation analysis revealed a probable relationship between B4GalT1 and autophagy related proteins. The B4GalT1 expression and mRNA level were increased in tumor cells, or U87 cells. B4GalT1 knocked down by lentivirus could inhibit glioblastoma development, in vitro and in vivo, by reducing tumor weight and volume, increasing survival, and weakening tumor cells proliferation, migration, invasion. B4GalT1 knockdown could increase apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrates that B4GalT1 may be able to regulate apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma. Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC3 s may be the downstream target factors of B4GalT1 in apoptosis and autophagy, which may provide a new strategy to reduce glioblastoma development by regulating apoptosis and autophagy.

B4GalT1 Regulates Apoptosis and Autophagy of Glioblastoma In Vitro and In Vivo.	33287670	Our study was designed to investigate the role of B4GalT1 in glioblastoma, in vitro and in vivo, to detect whether B4GalT1 knockdown could regulate the development of glioblastoma, and further observe the relationship between B4GalT1 knockdown and the apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma. To begin, we looked at TCGA and GEPIA systems to predict the potential function of B4GalT1. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression, or mRNA level, of B4GalT1 at different tissue or cell lines. Next, the occurrence and development of glioblastoma, in vitro and in vivo, was observed by using B4GalT1 knocked down by lentivirus. Finally, the apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma was observed in vitro and in vivo. Results show that B4GalT1 was a highly variable gene, and GEPIA and TCGA systems show B4GalT1 expression in GBM tumor tissue was higher than in normal tissue. Pair-wise gene correlation analysis revealed a probable relationship between B4GalT1 and autophagy related proteins. The B4GalT1 expression and mRNA level were increased in tumor cells, or U87 cells. B4GalT1 knocked down by lentivirus could inhibit glioblastoma development, in vitro and in vivo, by reducing tumor weight and volume, increasing survival, and weakening tumor cells proliferation, migration, invasion. B4GalT1 knockdown could increase apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrates that B4GalT1 may be able to regulate apoptosis and autophagy of glioblastoma. Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC3 s may be the downstream target factors of B4GalT1 in apoptosis and autophagy, which may provide a new strategy to reduce glioblastoma development by regulating apoptosis and autophagy.

Understanding the biological role of PqqB in Pseudomonas stutzeri using molecular dynamics simulation approach.	33287678	Phosphate solubilization is an important and widely studied plant growth promoting trait exhibited by many bacteria. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redox cofactor of methanol and glucose dehydrogenases has been well established as essential for phosphate solubilization. PQQ operon has been well studied in growth promoting rhizobacteria like Pseudomonas spp., Gluconobacter oxydans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, etc. However, the role of PqqB is quite ambiguous as its functional role has been contradicted in many studies. In the present study, we selected Pseudomonas stutzeri - a well-known P solubilizing bacterium as a representative species of the Pseudomonas genus on the basis of phylogenetic and statistical analyses of PqqB proteins. A 3 D model was generated for this protein. Docking of PqqB with PQQ showed good interaction with a theoretical binding affinity of -7.4 kcal/mol. On the other hand, docking of PqqC with 3a-(2-amino-2-carboxy-ethyl)-4,5-dioxo-4,5,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-quinoline-7,9-dicarboxylic acid (AHQQ, immediate precursor of PQQ) showed strong interaction (-10.4 kcal/mol) but the same was low with PQQ (-6.4 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulation of both the complexes showed stable conformation. The binding energy of PqqB-PQQ complex (-182.710 ± 16.585 kJ/mol) was greater than PqqC-PQQ complex (-166.114 ± 12.027 kJ/mol). The results clearly indicated that kinetically there is a possibility that after cyclization of AHQQ to PQQ by PqqC, PQQ can be taken up by PqqB and transported to periplasm for the oxidation of glucose. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand the biological role of PqqB on the basis of molecular interactions and dynamics. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Correlation between upper airway dimension and TMJ position in patients with sleep disordered breathing.	33287679	Objective: The goal was to perform a 10-year retrospective study on the correlation between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and upper airway dimensions, as well as the relation between SDB status and TMJ position. The study also examined links between airway dimensions and TMJ position. Methods: Patients were categorized into Control (n = 28) or SDB (n = 45). Cone beam (CBCT) data was analyzed using InVivo5™. Results: Although there were distinctive features within the SDB group, these did not show a correlation of significance with airway dimensions. SDB patients were more likely to have their condyles posteriorly seated. Other factors, such as presence of TMD, limited mouth opening, and pain upon palpation of masticatory muscles also significantly affected the TMJ position. Volumetric airway analysis showed links to TMJ position. Conclusion: SDB patients have a smaller airway volume and have a significant relationship between airway volume and TMJ position with their condyles seated more posteriorly.

Indigenous women's reproductive health in the Arctic zone of Western Siberia: challenges and solutions.	33287680	In the Russian Arctic, alarming trends (shortage of nomadic Indigenous women, high reproductive loss, child mortality rates) indicate long-term changes towards demographic decline. This study aimed at comparing some indicators of the reproductive health (childbirth rates, number of pregnancies, pregnancy loss) of Indigenous and non-Indigenous women in the exploration of cultural and social factors influencing reproductive behaviour. A multidisciplinary approach draws on methods of medicine, sociology and health economics. It includes data of the women's reproductive health collected from surveys of 879 women (of whom 627 were Indigenous) during expeditions to the settlements and the tundra of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in 2013-2019. In the tundra, 66.7% of registered Indigenous women's pregnancies resulted in childbirth, 7.8% in induced abortions, 25.5% in spontaneous miscarriage. More than three children were delivered by 59.1% of Indigenous women. Most Indigenous families suffered from high pregnancy loss. Marriage between close relatives was 27.0%. Child mortality equalled 24.4%, three times higher than in the population of the settlements and eight times higher than in families immigrating from other regions. The survival of Indigenous peoples significantly depends on women's reproductive health and sufficient medical service that requires targeted policy.	ĠYamal-Nenets	 Indigenous
MicroRNA Biomarkers in Canine Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	33287683	Lymphoma is among the most common cancer in dogs. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the predominant type, accounting for up to half of all cases. Definitive diagnosis of DLBCL relies on cytologic evaluation with immunophenotyping, or histopathology and immunohistochemistry when needed. A rapid and specific molecular test aiding in the diagnosis could be beneficial. Noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Not surprisingly, miRNA expression is aberrant in diseases such as cancers. Their high stability and abundance in tissues make them promising biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring diseases. This study aimed to identify miRNA signatures of DLBCL to develop ancillary molecular diagnostic tools. miRNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue from 22 DLBCL and 14 nonneoplastic controls. Relative gene expression of 8 tumor-regulating miRNAs was achieved by RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction). The results showed downregulation of the let-7 family of miRNAs and miR-155, whereas miR-34a was upregulated in DLBCL compared to the controls. We demonstrated that the combination of expression levels of miR-34a and let-7f or of let-7b and let-7f achieved 100% differentiation between DLBCL and controls. Furthermore, let-7f alone discriminated DLBCL from nonneoplastic tissue in 97% of cases. Our results represent one step forward in search of a rapid and accurate ancillary diagnostic test for DLBCL in dogs.	ĠmiRNAs	reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction

Perceptions of interdisciplinary bedside rounds by head nurses in Flanders: a cross-sectional exploration.	33287684	Objectives Interdisciplinary bedside rounds is gaining ground as a method to improve patient centredness and involvement, quality of care and team collaboration. An exploratory study was conducted in Flemish hospitals to (1) map and (2) examine the current form of rounds and the extent to which these were bedside, patient and family participatory and interdisciplinary. Methods In February 2020, a quantitative cross-sectional self-reporting web-based survey was conducted in 23 hospitals in Flanders, 213 head nurses of 213 wards completed the survey. A self-reporting 19-item questionnaire was developed in Lime Survey®. The questionnaire contained a mix of closed-ended questions an open-ended questions. The data were analysed using SPSS 26.0. Results Most of the wards in Flanders organise a form of daily rounds at the bedside. In only half of the wards these rounds are organised at a fixed time. The rounds most often include a physician and a nurse. Other disciplines are rarely actively involved. Only a minority of wards uses checklists, structures or protocols to standardise the rounds. The majority of the wards reports that patients (and family) get sufficient time to ask questions and say they are actively stimulated to do so. Conclusion In current practice, most rounds are (partially) bedside, open for patient and family participatory and often include only a physician and a nurse. However, these elements of interdisciplinary rounds are not yet well integrated and vary strongly amongst ward. Most rounds should be considered as an extended form of physician rounds, rather than being interdisciplinary.	S	 questionnaire

Effects of photobiomodulation on auriculotherapy points for sleep disorders, anxiety, and temporomandibular dysfunctions.	33287687	Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluatephotobiomodulation applied at auriculotherapy points forsleep disorder (SD) and anxiety related to temporomandibulardysfunction (TMD). Methods: The study consisted of two groups of 20 participants: Auriculotherapy group (A) and Control Group(C). The participants responded to the RDC/TMD, Fletcher & Luckett questionnaires, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory to analyze TMD, SD, and anxiety before and after the treatment. Results: The participants presented scores corresponding to mild to moderateanxiety (MDN = 17; CI = [13.16;22.31]) and after treatment, normalor non-existent anxiety (MDN = 9; CI = [8.76; 17.12]) (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the controland 20 auriculotherapy groups for TMD and SD. Discussion: The results suggest that auriculotherapy was effective in the treatment of anxiety. However, it did not prove effective with the results of the SD and symptoms of TMD.

Noise exposure assessment of occupational health and safety (OHS) consultants: A preliminary study.	33287688	No published noise exposure assessment of occupational health and safety (OHS) consultants exists. An assessment was performed to quantify the noise level of OHS consultants while they were on site at a client's facility. OHS consultants wore a dosimeter set to A-weighting, slow response, 60 s log interval and a criterion level of 85dBA with a 3 dB exchange rate. Both the projected time-weighted average (TWA) and projected dose were recorded. Of the 32 noise assessments collected, three had projected TWAs that exceeded the occupational exposure limit of 85 dBA. Nearly 75% of the projected TWA measurements were equal or greater than the Action Level of 80 dBA. According to best practices, occupational noise levels greater than 80 dBA present a risk for noise-induced hearing loss and, therefore, a hearing loss prevention program should be implemented.

Associations of menopausal age with virological outcomes and engagement in care among women living with HIV in the UK.	33287689	Background: Women ageing with HIV undergo sex-specific changes. There is limited evidence available with regards to how the menopause impacts HIV outcomes. Objective: To investigate whether menopausal age is associated with engagement-in-care (EIC), viral load (VL) suppression and rebound among women living with HIV. Methods: Women were grouped by age (<40, 40-50, >50 years), corresponding to pre-, peri- and post-menopausal stages. EIC, HIV VL suppression (VL < 50 copies/mL) within 12 months of antiretroviral therapy initiation and VL rebound (two consecutive VL > 50 copies/mL) after VL suppression were compared across age groups using logistic/Cox proportional hazards regression. Associations were compared to those seen in heterosexual men. Results: Six thousand four hundred and fifty-five (6455) eligible women (median age 36 [interquartile range: 29-42], 64.4% black African, 19.1% white) contributed 44,226 person-years (PYRS) of follow-up; 29,846, 10,980 and 3,399 PYRS in those aged <40, 40-50 and >50, respectively. Women were engaged-in-care for 79.5% of follow-up time, 3,344 (78.0%) experienced VL suppression and 739 (22.1%) VL rebound. After adjustment, women aged >50 years had lower EIC than those aged <40. Women aged 40-50 were more likely to have VL suppression and were less likely to experience VL rebound than those aged <40 years. Trends in heterosexual men were similar for EIC but with no evidence of a higher VL suppression rate in those aged 40-50 years (p int. 0< .0001) and a stronger protective association between older age and VL rebound (p int. 0< .0001). Conclusion: Our findings warrant further research into the potential impact of the menopause to support women and clinicians through HIV care.	PYRS	 person-years

The ritual use of ayahuasca during treatment of severe physical illnesses: a qualitative study.	33287690	Diseases that threaten life raise existential questions that can be a source of psychological distress. Studies with psychedelics demonstrate therapeutic effects for anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses. Ayahuasca has been proposed as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Preliminary studies suggest that ayahuasca could promote therapeutic effects for people with physical illnesses. The aim of this study was to explore how the ritual use of ayahuasca during the treatment of severe physical illnesses (SPI) may influence the way people understand and relate to their illness, using qualitative methods to assess the participants' perspectives. Participants who consumed ayahuasca ritualistically during the period of treatment for SPI were purposely chosen. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis was performed with 14 individuals. The ritual experience with ayahuasca acted on the participants' illness understanding through multiple psychological mechanisms, including introspection, self-analysis, emotional processing and catharsis, recall of autobiographical memories subjectively related to illness origin, illness resignification, and perspective changes. This study suggests that the experience with ayahuasca may facilitate illness acceptance through an influence on the meanings of the illness, life, and death. These changes may favor a more balanced relationship with illness and treatment.	SPI	 severe physical illnesses
Non-visible disease, the hidden disruptive experiences of chronic illness in adversity.	33287691	Objective: This study's principal aim was to describe the lived reality for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic health conditions, who live in economically deprived neighbourhoods in a city in North West England. Methodology: This is a qualitative, exploratory study based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with participants experiencing compromised cardiovascular health, conducted in August 2017. The study sample comprised 14 adults (3 females) aged 54 to 76. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis, and the biographical disruption concept was used as theoretical reference to explore the results. Wider health inequalities literature supplemented the individual experiences of chronic illness. Results: Four main themes were developed from the data: (1) chronic illness as a disruptive experience; (2) struggling for money; (3) lifestyle and health risks; and (4) reflections on current inequalities. The varied nature of participants' narratives about their chronic illness indicated that the experience of biographical disruption depends on the wider socioeconomic and cultural factors of the individual. Discussion: This study suggests that biographical disruption theory combined with health inequalities contexts highlights the role of hidden suffering and enhances the understanding of chronic illness experiences and thus informs clinical management, service and public health planning.

Regulation of the Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juvenile cathepsin L3 (FhCL3) by its propeptide: a proposed 'clamp-like' mechanism of binding and inhibition.	33287692	The zoonotic worm parasite Fasciola hepatica secretes an abundance of cathepsin L peptidases that are associated with virulence, invasiveness, feeding and migration. The peptidases are produced as inactive zymogens that activate at low pH by autocatalytic removal of their N-terminal pro-domain or propeptide. Propeptides bind to their cognate enzyme with high specificity. Little is known, however, about the mechanism by which the propeptide of FhCL3, a cathepsin L peptidase secreted by the infective newly excysted juveniles (NEJs), regulates the inhibition and activation of the mature enzyme before it is secreted into host tissues.

multiGSEA: a GSEA-based pathway enrichment analysis for multi-omics data.	33287694	Gaining biological insights into molecular responses to treatments or diseases from omics data can be accomplished by gene set or pathway enrichment methods. A plethora of different tools and algorithms have been developed so far. Among those, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) proved to control both type I and II errors well. In recent years the call for a combined analysis of multiple omics layers became prominent, giving rise to a few multi-omics enrichment tools. Each of these has its own drawbacks and restrictions regarding its universal application.	GSEA	 gene set enrichment analysis
Molecular signature comprising 11 platelet-genes enables accurate blood-based diagnosis of NSCLC.	33287695	Early diagnosis is crucial for effective medical management of cancer patients. Tissue biopsy has been widely used for cancer diagnosis, but its invasive nature limits its application, especially when repeated biopsies are needed. Over the past few years, genomic explorations have led to the discovery of various blood-based biomarkers. Tumor Educated Platelets (TEPs) have, of late, generated considerable interest due to their ability to infer tumor existence and subtype accurately. So far, a majority of the studies involving TEPs have offered marker-panels consisting of several hundreds of genes. Profiling large numbers of genes incur a significant cost, impeding its diagnostic adoption. As such, it is important to construct minimalistic molecular signatures comprising a small number of genes.	TEPs	 Tumor Educated Platelets

Strength and size of phosphorus-rich patches determine the foraging strategy of Neyraudia reynaudiana.	33287710	Under natural conditions, soil nutrients are heterogeneously distributed, and plants have developed adaptation strategies to efficiently forage patchily distributed nutrient. Most previous studies examined either patch strength or patch size separately and focused mainly on root morphological plasticity (increased root proliferation in nutrient-rich patch), thus the effects of both patch strength and size on morphological and physiological plasticity are not well understood. In this study, we examined the foraging strategy of Neyraudia reynaudiana (Kunth) Keng ex Hithc, a pioneer grass colonizing degraded sites, with respect to patch strength and size in heterogeneously distributed phosphorus (P), and how foraging patchily distributed P affects total plant biomass production. Plants were grown in sand-culture pots divided into ½, ¼, 1/6 compartments and full size and supplied with 0 + 0/30, 0 + 7.5/30 and 7.5 + 0/30 mg P/kg dry soil as KH2PO4 or 0 + 15/15, 0 + 18.5/ 18.5, 7.5 + 15/15 mg kg - 1 in the homogenous treatment. The first amount was the P concentration in the central region, and that the second amount was the P concentration in the outer parts of the pot.	P	 phosphorus

Overlapping-sample Mendelian randomisation with multiple exposures: a Bayesian approach.	33287714	Mendelian randomization (MR) has been widely applied to causal inference in medical research. It uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to investigate putative causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Traditional MR methods have mainly focussed on a two-sample setting in which IV-exposure association study and IV-outcome association study are independent. However, it is not uncommon that participants from the two studies fully overlap (one-sample) or partly overlap (overlapping-sample).	IVs	 instrumental variables

Prior exposure of Arabidopsis seedlings to mechanical stress heightens jasmonic acid-mediated defense against necrotrophic pathogens.	33287718	Prolonged mechanical stress (MS) causes thigmomorphogenesis, a stress acclimation response associated with increased disease resistance. What remains unclear is if; 1) plants pre-exposed to a short period of repetitive MS can prime defence responses upon subsequent challenge with necrotrophic pathogens, 2) MS mediates plant immunity via jasmonic acid (JA) signalling, and 3) a short period of repetitive MS can cause long-term changes in gene expression resembling a stress-induced memory. To address these points, 10-days old juvenile Arabidopsis seedlings were mechanically stressed for 7-days using a soft brush and subsequently challenged with the necrotrophic pathogens, Alternaria brassicicola, and Botrytis cinerea. Here we assessed how MS impacted structural cell wall appositions, disease symptoms and altered gene expression in response to infection.	JA	 jasmonic acid

Linkage mapping and QTL analysis of flowering time using ddRAD sequencing with genotype error correction in Brassica napus.	33287721	Brassica napus is an important oilseed crop cultivated worldwide. During domestication and breeding of B. napus, flowering time has been a target of selection because of its substantial impact on yield. Here we use double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) to investigate the genetic basis of flowering in B. napus. An F2 mapping population was derived from a cross between an early-flowering spring type and a late-flowering winter type.	ddRAD	 double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing
Barriers to access and utilisation of HIV/STIs prevention and care services among trans-women sex workers in the greater Kampala metropolitan area, Uganda.	33287723	Trans-women sex workers bear the greatest brunt of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Trans-women are 49 times more at risk of HIV infections compared to the general population. However, they remain underserved and continue to grapple with access to and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention services. This study explored barriers to access and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention services and associated coping mechanisms.	STI	 sexually transmitted infections
Health-related quality of life, palliative care needs and 12-month survival among patients with end stage renal disease in Uganda: protocol for a mixed methods longitudinal study.	33287725	"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is on the rise globally and in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to its ""silent"" nature, many patients often present with advanced disease. At this point options for care are often limited to renal replacement therapies such as hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. In resource limited settings, these options are associated with catastrophic expenditures and increased household poverty levels. Early palliative care interventions, if shown to ensure comparable quality of life (QoL), can significantly mitigate this by focusing care on comfort, symptom control and QoL rather than primarily on prolonging survival."

Target detection in healthy 4-week old piglets from a passive two-tone auditory oddball paradigm.	33287727	Passive auditory oddball tests are effort independent assessments that evaluate auditory processing and are suitable for paediatric patient groups. Our goal was to develop a two-tone auditory oddball test protocol and use this clinical assessment in an immature large animal model. Event-related potentials captured middle latency P1, N1, and P2 responses in 4-week old (N = 16, female) piglets using a custom piglet 32- electrode array on 3 non-consecutive days. The effect of target tone frequency (250 Hz and 4000 Hz) on middle latency responses were tested in a subset of animals.	ĠP1ĠN1	 middle latency
New view on the organization and evolution of Palaeognathae mitogenomes poses the question on the ancestral gene rearrangement in Aves.	33287726	Bird mitogenomes differ from other vertebrates in gene rearrangement. The most common avian gene order, identified first in Gallus gallus, is considered ancestral for all Aves. However, other rearrangements including a duplicated control region and neighboring genes have been reported in many representatives of avian orders. The repeated regions can be easily overlooked due to inappropriate DNA amplification or genome sequencing. This raises a question about the actual prevalence of mitogenomic duplications and the validity of the current view on the avian mitogenome evolution. In this context, Palaeognathae is especially interesting because is sister to all other living birds, i.e. Neognathae. So far, a unique duplicated region has been found in one palaeognath mitogenome, that of Eudromia elegans.	ĠAves	ian

O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and glucose transporter 2 in foregut and hindgut gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms.	33287738	Streptozocin (STZ) is used for treating both pancreatic (PanNET) and gastrointestinal (GI-NET) neuroendocrine tumors but its therapeutic efficacy is relatively low in GI-NETs. Therefore, it has become pivotal to select GI-NET patients who could benefit from STZ treatment. STZ is transported via the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) into the cells and the loss of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) also increases its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, GLUT2 high and MGMT low status could be the surrogate markers of STZ.	GLUT2	 glucose transporter 2

Immune-related protein signature in serum stratify relapsed mantle cell lymphoma patients based on risk.	33287742	Response to modern treatment strategies, which combine cytotoxic compounds with immune stimulatory agents and targeted treatment is highly variable among MCL patients. Thus, providing prognostic and predictive markers for risk adapted therapy is warranted and molecular information that can help in patient stratification is a necessity. In relapsed MCL, biopsies are rarely available and molecular information from tumor tissue is often lacking. Today, the main tool to access risk is the MCL international prognostic index (MIPI), which does not include detailed biological information of relevance for different treatment options. To enable continuous monitoring of patients, non-invasive companion diagnostic tools are needed which can further reduce cost and patient distress and enable efficient measurements of biological markers.

TRIM study protocol - a prospective randomized multicenter Trial to assess the Role of Imaging during follow-up after radical surgery of stage IIB-C and III cutaneous malignant Melanoma.	33287744	The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is increasing worldwide. In Sweden, over 4600 cases were diagnosed in 2018. The prognosis after radical surgery varies considerably with tumor stage. In recent years, new treatment options have become available for metastatic CMM. Early onset of treatment seems to improve outcome, which suggests that early detection of recurrent disease should be beneficial. Consequently, in several countries imaging is a part of the routine follow-up program after surgery of high risk CMM. However, imaging has drawbacks, including resources required (costs, personnel, equipment) and the radiation exposure. Furthermore, many patients experience anxiety in waiting for the imaging results and investigations of irrelevant findings is another factor that also could cause worry and lead to decreased quality of life. Hence, the impact of imaging in this setting is important to address and no randomized study has previously been conducted. The Swedish national guidelines stipulate follow-up for 3 years by clinical examinations only.	CMM	 cutaneous malignant melanoma

Differences in course of illness between patients with bipolar II disorder with and without epileptiform discharges or other sharp activity on electroencephalograms: a cross-sectional study.	33287748	A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder requires that the symptoms cannot be better explained by a medical condition. Epilepsy is in some cases associated with an affective syndrome mimicking an unstable bipolar II disorder. Epileptiform discharges on electroencephalograms (EEGs) are typical, but not pathognomonic, for epilepsy. A previous study has found a high frequency of epileptiform discharges and other sharp activity among patients with bipolar disorder. The aim of the study was to identify if epileptic discharges or other sharp activity per se are associated with an altered course of illness among patients with bipolar II disorder.

The exact pathogenesis of NEC in term infants with CHD is unknown, but it is hypothesized that ischemia of the intestines plays a pivotal role. We aimed to explore whether (near) term CHD infants, who develop NEC, exhibit more clinical signs of hypoxia/ischemia and low body perfusion directly after birth and during the first 48 hours after admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, when compared with (near) term CHD infants who did not develop NEC.

Effect of arthroscopic acromioplasty on reducing critical shoulder angle: a protocol for a prospective randomized clinical trial.	33287773	The critical shoulder angle (CSA), which helps to predict patients who are at risk of rotator cuff tears (RCTs) with large degree and who are susceptible to osteoarthritis with low angle, has been identified as one of the most vital acromial parameters; anterolateral and lateral acromioplasties have been proven to be valid ways to reduce CSA. However, no study has compared the effect of different acromioplasties on the reduction of the large CSA (≥33°) clinically. Additionally, either anterolateral or lateral acromioplasty could not precisely correct large CSAs to a favorable range (30-33°) in each patient. Thus, we will propose a novel precise acromioplasty technique for the purpose of reducing CSA accurately and effectively, and compare the effectiveness of different acromioplasties on the reduction of the CSA.

Prevention of re-establishment of malaria: historical perspective and future prospects.	33287809	"Prevention of re-establishment (POR) refers to the prevention of malaria outbreak/epidemic occurrence or preventing re-establishment of indigenous malaria in a malaria-free country. Understanding the effectiveness of the various strategies used for POR is, therefore, of vital importance to countries certified as ""malaria-free"" or to the countries to be thus certified in the near future. This review is based on extensive review of literature on both the POR strategies and elimination schemes of countries, (i) that have reached malaria-free status (e.g. Armenia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka), (ii) those that are reaching pre-elimination stage (e.g. South Korea), and (iii) countries at the control phase (e.g. India). History has clearly shown that poorly implemented POR programmes can result in deadly consequences (e.g. Sri Lanka); conversely, there are examples of robust POR programmes that have sustained malaria free status that can serve as examples to countries working toward elimination. Countries awaiting malaria elimination status should pre-plan their POR strategies. Malaria-free countries face the risk of resurgence mostly due to imported malaria cases; thus, a robust passenger screening programme and cross border collaborations are crucial in a POR setting. In addition, sustained vigilance, and continued funding for the national anti-malarial campaign programme and for related research is of vital importance for POR. With distinct intrinsic potential for malaria in each country, tailor-made POR programmes are built through continuous and robust epidemiological and entomological surveillance, particularly in countries such as Sri Lanka with increased receptivity and vulnerability for malaria transmission. In summary, across all five countries under scrutiny, common strengths of the POR programmes are (i) a multipronged approach, (ii) strong passive, active, and activated passive case detection, (iii) Indoor residual spraying (IRS), and (iv) health education/awareness programmes."

This review is based on extensive review of literature on both the POR strategies and elimination schemes of countries, (i) that have reached malaria-free status (e.g. Armenia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka), (ii) those that are reaching pre-elimination stage (e.g. South Korea), and (iii) countries at the control phase (e.g. India). History has clearly shown that poorly implemented POR programmes can result in deadly consequences (e.g. Sri Lanka); conversely, there are examples of robust POR programmes that have sustained malaria free status that can serve as examples to countries working toward elimination. Countries awaiting malaria elimination status should pre-plan their POR strategies. Malaria-free countries face the risk of resurgence mostly due to imported malaria cases; thus, a robust passenger screening programme and cross border collaborations are crucial in a POR setting. In addition, sustained vigilance, and continued funding for the national anti-malarial campaign programme and for related research is of vital importance for POR. With distinct intrinsic potential for malaria in each country, tailor-made POR programmes are built through continuous and robust epidemiological and entomological surveillance, particularly in countries such as Sri Lanka with increased receptivity and vulnerability for malaria transmission. In summary, across all five countries under scrutiny, common strengths of the POR programmes are (i) a multipronged approach, (ii) strong passive, active, and activated passive case detection, (iii) Indoor residual spraying (IRS), and (iv) health education/awareness programmes."

A descriptive study of allergen-specific IgE serological tests for canine atopic dermatitis in Thailand.	33287810	This study describes the usefulness of allergen-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) serology (ASIS) for identifying allergens in dogs with atopic dermatitis. ASIS tests were conducted in 23 dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis for indoor allergens (yeast and mites), outdoor allergens (grass pollen, weed pollen, and tree pollen), and fleas. The relationship among positive ASIS tests were determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r).	IgE	 Immunoglobulin E
Team-based learning replaces problem-based learning at a large medical school.	33287811	BACKGROUND: With increased student numbers in the Sydney Medical Program, and concerns regarding standardisation across cohorts, student satisfaction of the problem-based learning (PBL) model had decreased in recent years. In 2017, Team-based learning (TBL) replaced PBL in Years 1 and 2 of the medical program. This study sought to explore students' perceptions of their experience of TBL, and to consider resource implications.	TBL	 Team-based learning

How should we monitor the cardiovascular benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition?	33287812	Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure (HF). The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce such risk are likely to be independent of diabetes status and improvement of glycemic control. In this commentary, based on recent mediation analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, we discuss the prognostic role of a well-known HF-related biomarker, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Interestingly, the NT-proBNP concentration had a relatively small impact on the SGLT2 inhibitor-associated benefit on HF events, suggesting a limited value in measuring NT-proBNP concentrations to monitor effects on cardiovascular outcomes after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Instead, clinical factors, such as body weight and volume status, were prognostic for cardiovascular outcomes. As shown in some biomarker studies, short-term SGLT2 inhibitor treatment significantly improved volume and HF-related health status, despite the absence of a significant change in NT-proBNP concentration. Given the early and continuous risk reduction in HF events seen in the cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, changes in these fundamental clinical parameters after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, independent of NT-proBNP, could be more prognostic and could represent key determinants to identify responders or non-responders to SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, this commentary highlights the clinical importance of establishing how clinicians should monitor patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy to predict the expected cardiovascular benefit. Further detailed investigations and discussion to better understand this ''black box'' are urgently warranted.	NT-proBNP	 amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide

Insulin directly stimulates mitochondrial glucose oxidation in the heart.	33287820	Glucose oxidation is a major contributor to myocardial energy production and its contribution is orchestrated by insulin. While insulin can increase glucose oxidation indirectly by enhancing glucose uptake and glycolysis, it also directly stimulates mitochondrial glucose oxidation, independent of increasing glucose uptake or glycolysis, through activating mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of glucose oxidation. However, how insulin directly stimulates PDH is not known. To determine this, we characterized the impacts of modifying mitochondrial insulin signaling kinases, namely protein kinase B (Akt), protein kinase C-delta (PKC-δ) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), on the direct insulin stimulation of glucose oxidation.

Hyaluronic acid-coated polymeric micelles with hydrogen peroxide scavenging to encapsulate statins for alleviating atherosclerosis.	33287831	Inflammation and oxidative stress are two major factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. A smart drug delivery system that responds to the oxidative microenvironment of atherosclerotic plaques was constructed in the present study. Simvastatin (SIM)-loaded biodegradable polymeric micelles were constructed from hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(tyrosine-ethyl oxalyl) (PEG-Ptyr-EO) for the purpose of simultaneously inhibiting macrophages and decreasing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to treat atherosclerosis. HA coating endows the micelle system the ability of targeting CD44-positive inflammatory macrophages. Owing to the ROS-responsive nature of PEG-Ptyr-EO, the micelles can not only be degraded by enzymes, but also consumes ROS by itself at the pathologic sites, upon which the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages is effectively suppressed and oxidative stress is alleviated. Consequently, the cellular uptake experiment demonstrated that SIM-loaded HA-coated micelles can be effectively internalized by LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and showed high cytotoxicity against the cells, but low cytotoxicity against LO2 cells. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, intravenously SIM-loaded HA-coated micelles can effectively reduce plaque content of cholesterol, resulting in remarkable therapeutic effects. In conclusion, the SIM-loaded micelle system provides a promising and innovative option against atherosclerosis.	ROS	 reactive oxygen species

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of segmenting the BCa region from bladder wall region on MRI, and quantitatively measuring the invasion depth of the tumor mass in bladder lumen for further clinical decision-making. This retrospective study involved 20 eligible patients with postoperatively pathologically confirmed BCa. It was conducted in the following steps: (1) a total of 1159 features were extracted from each voxel of both the certain cancerous and wall tissues with the T2-weighted (T2W) MRI data; (2) the support vector machine (SVM)-based recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was implemented to first select an optimal feature subset, and then develop the classification model for the precise separation of the cancerous regions; (3) after excluding the cancerous region from the bladder wall, the three-dimensional bladder wall thickness (BWT) was calculated using Laplacian method, and the invasion depth of BCa was eventually defined by the subtraction of the mean BWT excluding the cancerous region and the minimum BWT of the cancerous region.

Electrocution as an alternative euthanasia method to blunt force trauma to the head followed by exsanguination for non-viable piglets.	33287837	On farms, the currently approved and most widely practised method of euthanising non-viable piglets is blunt force trauma to the head followed by exsanguination. However, the use of this method is criticised due to public perceptions and aversion to the methodology by caretakers. Therefore, electrocution after electrical stunning was examined as an alternative approach in 80 hybrid piglets. Initially, electrocution was simulated with finite element analysis using a computer piglet-model, where current density in the heart was visualised and size and position of the electrodes were defined. The following step investigated electrical parameters for electrocution in anaesthetised piglets; first, with a constant voltage power source and then with a constant current power source. The electrical stunning was examined using the constant current supply. Finally, the results of electrical stunning and electrocution were verified in 25 healthy piglets with a body weight between 1 and 2 kg. Unconsciousness was proven by testing palpebral, corneal and nociceptive reflexes. Time of death was confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) records.

Criteria for referral of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection: a real-life experience in the pandemic era.	33287859	A practical guidance on the management of children with COVID-19 to insure homogeneous criteria for referral to a higher-level facility, according to the disease severity, is pivotal in the pandemic era. A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases and intensive care at the tertiary-care Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy, issued a practical document shared with Tuscany hospitals. The rationale was to target the referral for those children at risk of requiring an intensive support, since the above mentioned hospital has the pediatric intensive care unit. Overall, 378 patients between 0 and 19 years of age were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the Tuscany region with 24 (6.3%) hospitalizations. Only three children were centralized to Meyer Children's University Hospital according to reported criteria. Considering that appropriate referral criteria have been associated with reduced mortality in other conditions, our document might be useful to improve outcomes of children with COVID-19.

Effect of acupuncture for methadone maintenance treatment patients: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial.	33287868	Opioid dependence is an increasing public health problem all over the world. Patients with opioid dependence have to receive methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) as replacement therapy for years or even for their entire life. Acupuncture as a kind of therapy has been used to treat substance dependence for many years. Jin's three-needle acupuncture (JTN), a type of acupuncture technique, has been applied to treat various diseases for several decades. However, JTN as an acupuncture technique has not been used to treat patients receiving MMT. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy for patients receiving MMT.	MMT	 methadone maintenance therapy
Alternative splicing in endothelial cells: novel therapeutic opportunities in cancer angiogenesis.	33287867	Alternative splicing (AS) is a pervasive molecular process generating multiple protein isoforms, from a single gene. It plays fundamental roles during development, differentiation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis, while aberrant AS is considered a hallmark of multiple diseases, including cancer. Cancer-restricted AS isoforms represent either predictive biomarkers for diagnosis/prognosis or targets for anti-cancer therapies. Here, we discuss the contribution of AS regulation in cancer angiogenesis, a complex process supporting disease development and progression. We consider AS programs acting in a specific and non-redundant manner to influence morphological and functional changes involved in cancer angiogenesis. In particular, we describe relevant AS variants or splicing regulators controlling either secreted or membrane-bound angiogenic factors, which may represent attractive targets for therapeutic interventions in human cancer.

Microglial replacement therapy: a potential therapeutic strategy for incurable CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy.	33287883	CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy is an adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia caused by colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene mutations. The disease has a global distribution and currently has no cure. Individuals with CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy variably present clinical symptoms including cognitive impairment, progressive neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms. CSF1R is predominantly expressed on microglia within the central nervous system (CNS), and thus CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy is now classified as a CNS primary microgliopathy. This urgent unmet medical need could potentially be addressed by using microglia-based immunotherapies. With the rapid recent progress in the experimental microglial research field, the replacement of an empty microglial niche following microglial depletion through either conditional genetic approaches or pharmacological therapies (CSF1R inhibitors) is being studied. Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers an emerging means of exchanging dysfunctional microglia with the aim of reducing brain lesions, relieving clinical symptoms and prolonging the life of patients with CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. This review article introduces recent advances in microglial biology and CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. Potential therapeutic strategies by replacing microglia in order to improve the quality of life of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy patients will be presented.	CNS	 central nervous system

Use of low-molecular-weight heparin in severe paraquat poisoning: a case report.	33287885	Acute paraquat ingestion remains a leading cause of mortality in developing countries. There is currently no evidence that treatment with high-dose immunosuppressants and antioxidants improves survival in patients with paraquat poisoning, and better options are urgently needed. Here, we describe the unexpected survival and recovery of a patient with a potentially fatal paraquat poisoning.	Ġhigh-dose	 para
Effects of H3.3G34V mutation on genomic H3K36 and H3K27 methylation patterns in isogenic pediatric glioma cells.	33287886	Histone H3.3 mutation (H3F3A) occurs in 50% of cortical pediatric high-grade gliomas. This mutation replaces glycine 34 with arginine or valine (G34R/V), impairing SETD2 activity (H3K36-specific trimethyltransferase). Consequently, reduced H3K36me3 is observed on H3.3G34V nucleosomes relative to wild-type, contributing to genomic instability and driving a distinct gene expression signature associated with tumorigenesis. However, it is not known if this differential H3K36me3 enrichment is due to H3.3G34V mutant protein alone. Therefore, we set to elucidate the effect of H3.3G34V mutant protein in pediatric glioma on H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment in vitro. We found that the doxycycline-inducible shRNA knockdown of mutant H3F3A encoding the H3.3G34V protein resulted in loss of H3.3G34V enrichment and increased H3K36me3 enrichment throughout the genome. After knockdown, H3.3G34V enrichment was preserved at loci observed to have the greatest H3.3G34V and H3K36me3 enrichment prior to knockdown. Induced expression of mutant H3.3G34V protein in vitro was insufficient to induce genomic H3K36me3 enrichment patterns observed in H3.3G34V mutant glioma cells. We also observed strong co-enrichment of H3.3G34V and wild-type H3.3 protein, as well as greater H3K27me3 enrichment, in cells expressing H3.3G34V. Taken together, our study demonstrates the effects of H3.3G34V mutant protein on genomic H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment patterns in isogenic cell lines.	G34R/V	 arginine
Mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents across all settings: a scoping review protocol.	33287887	Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are becoming increasingly popular, the application of MBIs with children and adolescents is still in its infancy. Mapping the existing literature is necessary to help guide pediatric mindfulness interventions. Our purpose is to synthesize the evidence of reported MBIs for children and adolescents with and without physical, mental, and cognitive disorders. Accordingly, we aim to identify trends and gaps in the literature, so that we can provide direction to researchers who seek to advance the evidence base for using MBIs in pediatric populations.

Impaired lipid metabolism in astrocytes underlies degeneration of cortical projection neurons in hereditary spastic paraplegia.	33287888	Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are caused by a length-dependent axonopathy of long corticospinal neurons, but how axons of these cortical projection neurons (PNs) degenerate remains elusive. We generated isogenic human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines for two ATL1 missense mutations associated with SPG3A, the most common early-onset autosomal dominant HSP. In hPSC-derived cortical PNs, ATL1 mutations resulted in reduced axonal outgrowth, impaired axonal transport, and accumulated axonal swellings, recapitulating disease-specific phenotypes. Importantly, ATL1 mutations dysregulated proteolipid gene expression, reduced lipid droplet size in astrocytes, and unexpectedly disrupted cholesterol transfer from glia to neurons, leading to cholesterol deficiency in SPG3A cortical PNs. Applying cholesterol or conditioned medium from control astrocytes, a major source of cholesterol in the brain, rescued aberrant axonal transport and swellings in SPG3A cortical PNs. Furthermore, treatment with the NR1H2 agonist GW3965 corrected lipid droplet defects in SPG3A astrocytes and promoted cholesterol efflux from astrocytes, leading to restoration of cholesterol levels and rescue of axonal degeneration in SPG3A cortical PNs. These results reveal a non-cell autonomous mechanism underlying axonal degeneration of cortical PNs mediated by impaired cholesterol homeostasis in glia.	hPSC	 human pluripotent stem cell

The role of Nrf2 in acute and chronic muscle injury.	33287890	The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is considered as a master cytoprotective factor regulating the expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying proteins. The role of Nrf2 in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscles has been evaluated in different experimental models, however, due to inconsistent data, we aimed to investigate how Nrf2 transcriptional deficiency (Nrf2tKO) affects muscle functions both in an acute and chronic injury. The acute muscle damage was induced in mice of two genotypes-WT and Nrf2tKO mice by cardiotoxin (CTX) injection. To investigate the role of Nrf2 in chronic muscle pathology, mdx mice that share genetic, biochemical, and histopathological features with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were crossed with mice lacking transcriptionally active Nrf2 and double knockouts (mdx/Nrf2tKO) were generated. To worsen the dystrophic phenotype, the analysis of disease pathology was also performed in aggravated conditions, by applying a long-term treadmill test. We have observed slightly increased muscle damage in Nrf2tKO mice after CTX injection. Nevertheless, transcriptional ablation of Nrf2 in mdx mice did not significantly aggravate the most deleterious, pathological hallmarks of DMD related to degeneration, inflammation, fibrotic scar formation, angiogenesis, and the number and proliferation of satellite cells in non-exercised conditions. On the other hand, upon chronic exercises, the degeneration and inflammatory infiltration of the gastrocnemius muscle, but not the diaphragm, turned to be increased in Nrf2tKOmdx in comparison to mdx mice. In conclusion, the lack of transcriptionally active Nrf2 influences moderately muscle pathology in acute CTX-induced muscle injury and chronic DMD mouse model, without affecting muscle functionality. Hence, in general, we demonstrated that the deficiency of Nrf2 transcriptional activity has no profound impact on muscle pathology in various models of muscle injury.	DMD	 Duchenne muscular dystrophy

Influence of APOE genotype in primary age-related tauopathy.	33287896	"The term ""Primary age-related tauopathy"" (PART) was coined in 2014 to describe the common neuropathological observation of neurofibrillary tangles without associated beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. It is possible for PART pathology to be present in both cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Genetically, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 has been shown to occur less commonly in PART than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the relationships between PART, AD and those pathologically normal for age, with an emphasis on APOE and cognition, using 152 selected participants from The University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition in Normal Healthy Old Age and the Manchester arm of the Brains for Dementia Research cohort. APOE genotype differed between PART and AD with APOE ε2 more common in the former and APOE ε4 more common in the latter. Individuals with definite PART were less likely to be cognitively impaired than those with AD and those with pathology considered pathologically normal for age. We postulate that the lack of Aβ in definite PART cases may be due either to an increased frequency of APOE ε2 or decreased frequency of APOE ε4 as their resulting protein isoforms have differing binding properties in relation to Aβ. Similarly, an increased frequency of APOE ε2 or decreased frequency of APOE ε4 may lead to decreased levels of cognitive impairment, which raises questions regarding the impact of Aβ pathology on overall cognition in elderly subjects. We suggest that it may be possible to use the increased frequency of APOE ε2 in definite PART to assist neuropathological diagnosis."	AD	 Alzheimer's disease

Infusion of blood from mice displaying cerebral amyloidosis accelerates amyloid pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.	33287898	Previous studies showed that injection of tissue extracts containing amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates accelerate amyloid deposition in the brain of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through prion-like mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated whether brain amyloidosis could be accelerated by blood infusions, procedures that have been shown to transmit prion diseases in animals and humans. Young transgenic mice infused with whole blood or plasma from old animals with extensive Aβ deposition in their brains developed significantly higher levels brain amyloidosis and neuroinflammation compared to untreated animals or mice infused with wild type blood. Similarly, intra-venous injection of purified Aβ aggregates accelerated amyloid pathology, supporting the concept that Aβ seeds present in blood can reach the brain to promote neuropathological alterations in the brain of treated animals. However, an amyloid-enhancing effect of other factors present in the blood of donors cannot be discarded. Our results may help to understand the role of peripheral (amyloid-dependent or -independent) factors implicated in the development of AD and uncover new strategies for disease intervention.

Collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component impacts on the compaction of amyloid-β plaques.	33287899	Massive deposition of amyloid β peptides (Aβ) as senile plaques (SP) characterizes the brain pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SPs exhibit a variety of morphologies, although little is known about the SP components that determine their morphology. Collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component (CLAC) is one of the major non-Aβ proteinaceous components of SP amyloid in AD brains. Here we show that overexpression of CLAC precursor (CLAC-P) in the brains of APP transgenic mice results in a significant remodeling of amyloid pathology, i.e., reduction in diffuse-type amyloid plaques and an increase in compact plaques laden with thioflavin S-positive amyloid cores. In vivo microdialysis revealed a significant decrease in Aβ in the brain interstitial fluid of CLAC-P/APP double transgenic mice compared with APP transgenic mice. These findings implicate CLAC in the compaction of Aβ in amyloid plaques and the brain dynamics of Aβ.	CLAC	 Collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component

Retinal ganglion cell degeneration correlates with hippocampal spine loss in experimental Alzheimer's disease.	33287900	Neuronal dendritic and synaptic pruning are early features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In addition to brain pathology, amyloid plaque deposition, microglial activation, and cell loss occur in the retinas of human patients and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, are vulnerable to damage in neurodegenerative diseases and are a potential opportunity for non-invasive clinical diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's progression. However, the extent of retinal involvement in Alzheimer's models and how well this reflects brain pathology is unclear. Here we have quantified changes in retinal ganglion cells dendritic structure and hippocampal dendritic spines in three well-studied Alzheimer's mouse models, Tg2576, 3xTg-AD and APPNL-G-F. Dendritic complexity of DiOlistically labelled retinal ganglion cells from retinal explants was reduced in all three models in an age-, gender-, and receptive field-dependent manner. DiOlistically labelled hippocampal slices showed spine loss in CA1 apical dendrites in all three Alzheimer's models, mirroring the early stages of neurodegeneration as seen in the retina. Morphological classification showed that loss of thin spines predominated in all. The demonstration that retinal ganglion cells dendritic field reduction occurs in parallel with hippocampal dendritic spine loss in all three Alzheimer's models provide compelling support for the use of retinal neurodegeneration. As retinal dendritic changes are within the optical range of current clinical imaging systems (for example optical coherence tomography), our study makes a case for imaging the retina as a non-invasive way to diagnose disease and monitor progression in Alzheimer's disease.

KVarPredDB: a database for predicting pathogenicity of missense sequence variants of keratin genes associated with genodermatoses.	33287903	Germline variants of ten keratin genes (K1, K2, K5, K6A, K6B, K9, K10, K14, K16, and K17) have been reported for causing different types of genodermatoses with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Among all the variants of these ten keratin genes, most of them are missense variants. Unlike pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, understanding the clinical importance of novel missense variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) is the biggest challenge for clinicians or medical geneticists. Functional characterization is the only way to understand the clinical association of novel missense variants or VUS but it is time consuming, costly, and depends on the availability of patient's samples. Existing databases report the pathogenic variants of the keratin genes, but never emphasize the systematic effects of these variants on keratin protein structure and genotype-phenotype correlation.

Alpha connectivity and inhibitory control in adults with autism spectrum disorder.	33287904	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often report difficulties with inhibition in everyday life. During inhibition tasks, adults with ASD show reduced activation of and connectivity between brain areas implicated in inhibition, suggesting impairments in inhibitory control at the neural level. Our study further investigated these differences by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the frequency band(s) in which functional connectivity underlying response inhibition occurs, as brain functions are frequency specific, and whether connectivity in certain frequency bands differs between adults with and without ASD.

The haplotypes of various TNF related genes associated with scleritis in Chinese Han.	33287909	Several studies have stated that TNF-α participates in the pathogenesis of scleritis, but also in several systemic autoimmune diseases and vasculitis, of which some are associated with scleritis. Earlier GWAS and SNP studies have confirmed that multiple SNPs of TNF related genes are associated with many immune-mediated disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of TNF related gene polymorphisms with scleritis in Chinese Han. A case-control study was carried out in 556 non-infectious scleritis cases and 742 normal controls. A total of 28 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by the iPLEXGold genotyping assay.	SNPs	 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
Primary gastroduodenal tuberculosis complicated with acute pancreatitis: a rare case report and literature review.	33287912	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem worldwide. Even in highly prevalent countries, primary gastroduodenal tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In recent years, as the incidence of tuberculosis has increased year by year, the occur of gastroduodenal tuberculosis has also increased. Endoscopy is an important tool for diagnosing gastroduodenal tuberculosis. The performance of gastroduodenal tuberculosis under endoscopy is often non-specific, which may imitate other benign or malignant gastroduodenal diseases. Diagnosis of gastroduodenal tuberculosis relies on a combination of endoscopy and guided biopsy.	TB	 Tuberculosis

MAPT subhaplotypes in corticobasal degeneration: assessing associations with disease risk, severity of tau pathology, and clinical features.	33287913	The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1 haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for corticobasal degeneration (CBD). However, the specific H1 subhaplotype association is not well defined, and it is not clear whether any MAPT haplotypes influence severity of tau pathology or clinical presentation in CBD. Therefore, in the current study we examined 230 neuropathologically confirmed CBD cases and 1312 controls in order to assess associations of MAPT haplotypes with risk of CBD, severity of tau pathology (measured as semi-quantitative scores for coiled bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic plaques, and neuropil threads), age of CBD onset, and disease duration. After correcting for multiple testing (P < 0.0026 considered as significant), we confirmed the strong association between the MAPT H2 haplotype and decreased risk of CBD (Odds ratio = 0.26, P = 2 × 10-12), and also observed a novel association between the H1d subhaplotype and an increased CBD risk (Odds ratio = 1.76, P = 0.002). Additionally, although not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing, the H1c haplotype was associated with a higher risk of CBD (Odds ratio = 1.49, P = 0.009). No MAPT haplotypes were significantly associated with any tau pathology measures, age of CBD onset, or disease duration. Though replication will be important and there is potential that population stratification could have influenced our findings, these results suggest that several MAPT H1 subhaplotypes are primarily responsible for the strong association between MAPT H1 and risk of CBD, but that H1 subhaplotypes are unlikely to play a major role in driving tau pathology or clinical features. Our findings also indicate that similarities in MAPT haplotype risk-factor profile exist between CBD and the related tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy, with H2, H1d, and H1c displaying associations with both diseases.

The relationship between gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori cytotoxin-related gene A genotypes.	33287914	Gastric cancer has been known as the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. It is when cancer cells form on the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Helicobacter pylori is the most common microscopic creature that has infected humans worldwide. More than half of the world's population is infected with the bacterium. It is the main cause of diseases such as stomach ulcers and stomach and intestinal disorders. H. pylori infection is related to gastric adenocarcinoma and cagA genotype is believed to be related to cancer development. cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) is a 120-145kDa protein encoded on the 40kb cag pathogenicity island (PAI). This study investigates the association between cagA H. pylori genotypes and gastric cancer. For this purpose, 65 stomach biopsies of the gastric cancer patients and 100 saliva samples were collected from healthy and H. pylori-infected individuals. Then genomic DNA was purified and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed for the studied gene using specific primers. The presence of H. pylori was investigated by PCR and a pair of specific primers for a protected region in the bacterium glmM gene. Then cagA+ and cagA- genotypes frequencies were determined in H. pylori-infected cases. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences between healthy and diseased ones for genotypes cagA+ and cagA-. Then the cagA+ can be a risk factor genotype for gastric cancer.

Effects of miR-7 on Hcy-induced rat cerebral arterial vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration and inflammatory factor expression by targeting MMP-14 to regulate TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.	33287916	The current research aimed to investigate the effect of miR-7 targeting matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) on homocysteine (Hcy)-induced rat cerebral artery vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation, migration and inflammatory factor expression and its possible mechanism. The expression of miR-7 and MMP-14 in Hcy-induced VSMCs were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) method, Transwell assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to detect the effect of miR-7 and MMP-14 expression on the proliferation and migration, as well as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor ɑ (TNF-ɑ) expression of Hcy-induced VSMCs. The interaction between miR-7 and MMP-14 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Western blot was applied to analyse the effects of miR-7 and MMP-14 expression on the Toll-like receptor (TLR4)/nuclear transcription factor-KB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The results showed that after induced by Hcy, the expression of miR-7 in VSMCs was significantly reduced, the expression of MMP-14 was significantly increased, and the cell viability, the number of migrating cells, IL-6 and TNF-ɑ expression were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). After overexpression of miR-7, the viability, migration cell numbers, IL-6 and TNF-ɑ expression of Hcy-induced VSMCs were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). miR-7 directly binds to MMP-14 and negatively regulates the expression of MMP-14. After overexpression of miR-7, the levels of TLR4 and p-NF-κB p65 in VSMCs were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05); overexpression of MMP-14 could reduce the effect of miR-7 overexpression on TLR4 and p-NF-κB p65 expression in VSMCs (P&lt;0.05). Overexpression of MMP-14 and/or activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway could reverse the effect of miR-7 overexpression on the proliferation, migration and IL-6 and TNF-ɑ expression of Hcy-induced VSMCs (P&lt;0.05). It is concluded that miR-7 can inhibit Hcy-induced rat cerebral artery VSMCs proliferation, migration, and inflammatory factor expression by targeting the regulation of MMP-14 expression and inhibiting the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Multi-omics analysis profile oral tumor module clusters to reveal the potential pathogenic mechanism.	33287918	Oral tumors are malignant cancers caused by abnormal proliferation or pathological changes of soft or hard tissues in the oral cavity. Serious cases may pose a threat to life. However, its precancerous lesions remain unclear. This study is based on a comprehensive strategy to explore a multi-factor-driven oral cancer barrier module, which is an attempt to describe the pathogenesis of the disease and potential regulatory drugs from a global perspective. Functional disease modules were identified by constructing a protein-specific interaction network in patients' oral tissues. Then, comprehensive pathogenesis was explored through combination with analysis of functional and signaling pathway enrichment, prediction of key regulatory factors. It was found that these specifically expressed proteins and their interactions often play a pivotal part in oral tumors. This is reflected in the results of functional and pathway enrichment of modulating genes, which show that they are mainly involved in various immune responses, inflammatory reactions, oral plaque, and oral ulcer-related regulatory processes. This may represent the potential pathogenesis of oral tumors. On the predictive analysis of regulators, a series of ncRNAs (including miR-590, CRNDE and miR-340) and transcription factors (including E2F1, MYC and TP53) were identified that have potential important regulatory effects on oral tumors. These key regulators may manipulate a crucial part of the module sub-network and then work together to mediate the occurrence of oral tumors. On the comprehensive Multi-omics module analysis, the specific proteins and their interactions in patients' oral tissues were identified, while the prominent pivotal regulators were involved in the different pathogenic functions of oral tumors.

The effect of sevoflurane on the spatial recall ability and expression of apolipoprotein E and β amyloid in the hippocampus in rats.	33287920	This study aimed to observe the recent spatial recall ability and the changes of expression of hippocampal apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and amyloid β protein (Aβ) in adult rats after inhaling sevoflurane anesthetic drugs, and to analyze the mechanism of action. For this purpose, a total of 54 adult SD clean-grade rats were selected in this study and were randomly divided into the sevoflurane anesthesia group, carrier gas group and control group, 18 rats in each group. The rats in the carrier gas group were inhaled with 1 L/min of oxygen O2+1 L/min air mixed carrier gas for 2 h, and the rats in the sevoflurane anesthesia group were given 3.2%sevoflurane for 2 hours based on the carrier gas group, the control rats were naturally reared. Before the model was copied, the Morris water maze experiment was performed before the material was taken. Some rat brain tissues were extracted on the first day (T1), the third day (T3), and the seventh day (T7) after model replication. The immunohistochemistry was used to measure the mean optical density (MOD) value of APOE and Aβ in hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG regions. The indicators above at different time points of each group were compared and analyzed. Results showed that the number of crossing the original platform at each time point, the residence time of the original platform quadrant, the number of entering the original platform quadrant, and the percentage of the original platform quadrant residence time in the sevoflurane anesthesia group and the carrier gas group were compared, and there were no significant differences between two groups (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the carrier gas group, the MOD values of APOE in the hippocampus at T1 and T3 time points in the sevoflurane anesthesia group were decreased (P&lt;0.05), the MOD values of Aβ in the hippocampus at the T7 time point were increased (P&lt;0.05). It concluded that Inhalation of 3.2%sevoflurane has no obvious damage to the recent spatial recall ability of adult rats. Within 7 days after inhalation of 3.2% sevoflurane, it can inhibit hippocampus Aβ deposition through down-regulating APOE expression level. The critical time point for hippocampal Aβ increasing was 7 days after anesthesia.	MOD	 mean optical density

Circulatory miRNA-155, miRNA-21 target PTEN expression and activity as a factor in breast cancer development.	33287921	Breast cancer is a complex disease with multiple factors involved in its pathophysiological development. genetic mutations of BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53 are among the most well-studied factors. The role of other genetic factors like altered expression profiles, SNPs in the regulatory regions of different genes or epigenetic factors like promoter methylation and histone modifications are also well studied but no solid understanding is available on distinct key players triggering malignancy in breast cancer, (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) PTEN is known to be a crucial tumor suppressor as it has been reported to be missing or abnormally expressed in many cancer cells. Here in this were studied how PTEN is expressed in malignant and benign cancer cells by investigating its expression profile and cellular location using Immuno-fluorescence microscopy. At the same time, quantitative studies of the circulatory mi-RNAs related to the downregulation of PTEN, namely mir-21 and mir-155 have studied also. Sixty biopsy samples, forty were diagnosed to be malignant and twenty were benign. It has been found that PTEN is normally expressed in benign samples and its normally localized in the cell membrane, while in malignant samples the expression level of PTEN is lower or absent and it is translocated to the cytoplasm. Interestingly the quantitative expression of circulatory mir-21 and mir-155 in the blood plasma of the corresponding patients showed a related pattern with higher expression in malignant samples, therefore can it's clear that PTEN is in the cross-talk of genetics and epigenetic regulation in regard of the development of malignant breast cancer. At the same time, this study confirms the importance of circulatory miRNAs as a biomarker for early breast cancer detection.	Ġmi-RNAs	 microscopy

The effect of Ultraviolet-B irradiation on the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin as inhibitors of bacterial DNA replication and cell division in urea medium.	33287922	Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and Norfloxacin are second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic against bacterial DNA gyrase, which reduces DNA strain throughout replication. As DNA gyrase is essential through DNA replication, subsequent DNA synthesis and cell division are inhibited. Direct photolysis of fluoroquinolones was studied by using UV irradiation in the presence or absence of other substances that generate free radicals. This study aimed to assess the effect of Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in removing ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by using a simulating model of wastewater contained urea at pH 4. A known concentration of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were prepared in an appropriate aqueous solution in presence or absence 0.2M urea and adjusted at pH 4. The dis-solved drugs were irradiated with UVB-lamp in a dark place for 60 minutes. The percent of removal and the rate of elimination (k) of each drug were calculated. The direct photolysis effect of UVB irradiation was observed with ciprofloxacin which amounted to 24.4% removal compared with12.4% removal of norfloxacin after 60 minutes of irradiation. The effect of UVB irradiation was enhanced by urea to reach 38.9% and 15% for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The calculated k of ciprofloxacin has amounted to three folds of that of norfloxacin. Direct photolysis of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin can be achieved simply by using a simulation model of 0.2 M urea and UVB irradiation at pH 4. UVB is highly effective in removing ciprofloxacin compared with norfloxacin by 2-3 folds.	UVB	 Ultraviolet B

This experiment was set up to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of Dendrobium polysaccharide on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced damage to the human brain microvascular endothelial cells. For this purpose, human brain microvascular endothelial cells HBMEC were divided into control group (without any treatment), ox-LDL group (50 μg/mL ox-LDL), Dendrobium polysaccharide low, medium and high concentration group (0.1 μg/L, 0.2 μg/L, 0.4 μg/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 μg/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+miR-NC group (transfection miR-378 mimic negative control+50 μg/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+miR-378 group (transfected miR-378 mimics+50 μg/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+DP+anti-miR-NC group (transfected miR-378 inhibitor negative control +0.4 μg/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 μg/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+DP+anti-miR-378 group (transfected miR-378 inhibitor+0.4 μg/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 μg/mL ox-LDL ). The kit was used to detect the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); flow cytometry to detect apoptosis; and Western blot to detect B-cell lymph tumor/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 related X (Bax) protein expression; real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-378.

Relationship between TIM-3 gene polymorphisms and steroid-resistant primary nephrotic syndrome in children.	33287925	Nephrotic syndrome, also known as nephrosis, is a collection of symptoms in medicine and urology caused by damage to the basement membrane of the kidney glomeruli and the kidneys excrete a large amount of protein. This experiment was carried out to investigate the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-3 (Tim-3) with childhood primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) steroid response in Han Chinese. For this purpose, a total of 218 children with steroid-resistant PNS and 189 children with steroid-responsive PNS were enrolled in this case-control study. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TIM-3 gene promoter region (rs4704853, rs1051746, and rs10053538) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion.  Results showed that there were 124 males and 94 females in the steroid-resistant PNS group and 114 males and 75 females in the steroid-responsive PNS group. The mean ages of the two groups were 7.9 years and 7.7 years, respectively. The distribution of alleles of Rs1051746 and Rs10053538 were significantly different between the steroid-resistant PNS group and the steroid-responsive PNS group (P-value = 0.047 and 0.012, respectively). The distribution of their genotypes was also significantly different between the steroid-resistant PNS group and the steroid-responsive PNS group (P-value = 0.044 and 0.010, respectively). Haplotype G-C-G was less frequent among steroid-resistant PNS children than the steroid-responsive PNS children (P = 0.015). There was no significant difference between the three SNPs of TIM-3 and the clinical features of these PNS children (P&gt;0.05). It concluded that this study provided evidence showing that the polymorphisms of Rs1051746 and Rs10053538 at the TIM-3 gene were related to childhood PNS steroid response. This result provided fundamental support for future studies on the role of TIM-3 in pathogenesis and therapy of childhood PNS.	PCR	 polymerase chain reaction

For this purpose, a total of 218 children with steroid-resistant PNS and 189 children with steroid-responsive PNS were enrolled in this case-control study. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TIM-3 gene promoter region (rs4704853, rs1051746, and rs10053538) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion.  Results showed that there were 124 males and 94 females in the steroid-resistant PNS group and 114 males and 75 females in the steroid-responsive PNS group. The mean ages of the two groups were 7.9 years and 7.7 years, respectively. The distribution of alleles of Rs1051746 and Rs10053538 were significantly different between the steroid-resistant PNS group and the steroid-responsive PNS group (P-value = 0.047 and 0.012, respectively). The distribution of their genotypes was also significantly different between the steroid-resistant PNS group and the steroid-responsive PNS group (P-value = 0.044 and 0.010, respectively). Haplotype G-C-G was less frequent among steroid-resistant PNS children than the steroid-responsive PNS children (P = 0.015). There was no significant difference between the three SNPs of TIM-3 and the clinical features of these PNS children (P&gt;0.05). It concluded that this study provided evidence showing that the polymorphisms of Rs1051746 and Rs10053538 at the TIM-3 gene were related to childhood PNS steroid response. This result provided fundamental support for future studies on the role of TIM-3 in pathogenesis and therapy of childhood PNS.	PNS	 primary nephrotic syndrome

Atomic force microscope observation of athletes' hemoglobin imaging.	33287927	Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein and its functional form has a tetrameric structure. This structure is the result of a combination of four sub-units called globin and indicates the dynamic interaction between them. Each subunit has a ring-shaped organic molecule called a heme that contains an iron atom; Heme is a group that mediates the reversible binding of oxygen by hemoglobin. This research was performed to observe the image of Hb by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and measure the physical function of athletes. For this purpose, based on the principle of AFM imaging, the hemoglobin crosslinking method was used to measure the morphology and size of cross-linked Hb, glutaraldehyde and Hb diameter were detected to prepare cross-linked Hb samples with different molar ratio, the activity of peroxidase was detected by Trinder reaction. The AFM was used to detect the influence of physiological environment changes such as pH, temperature, oxygen partial pressure and osmotic pressure on the absorption spectrum of Hb imaging. Results showed that the size of the uncrosslinked Hb was 6.64 nm. With the increase of the molar ratio of glutaraldehyde to Hb, the number of Hb molecules involved in the crosslinking increased, and the molecular size increased. During the crosslinking process, the aggregation of the cross-linked molecules would make the particle size of some Hb molecules reach 80-100 nm. The peak height, peak position and peak shape of the characteristic absorption peaks of pH to hemoglobin at 550 and 589 nm occurred. When the temperature changes continuously in the range of 30-55℃, the peak height of Hb absorption spectrum of normal red blood cells at 550 nm and 589 nm decreases gradually with the increase of temperature, and the peak shape at 610 nm changes obviously at 42℃, which indicates that the molecular structure of Hb changes; the absorption spectrum curve of deoxygenation disappears at 500 nm, the oxygen-binding capacity of Hb is very low, and the oxygen affinity and oxygenated hemoglobin are low (The concentration of HbO2) decreased, the osmotic pressure increased, the RBC dehydrated, the volume decreased, and the concentration of Hb increased. Conclusion: It is more accurate and comprehensive to use AFM to observe athletes' hemoglobin.	ĠHb	 hemoglobin

Design of abnormal data detection system for protein gene library based on data mining technology.	33287929	In view of the shortcomings of the current abnormal data detection system of the protein gene library, such as low detection rate and high error detection rate, the abnormal data detection system of the protein gene library based on data mining technology is designed. The protein gene enters the firewall module of the system, and enters the immune module when it does not match the firewall rules; the memory detector in the immune module presents the protein gene, if the memory detector does not match the protein gene, the mature detector presents the protein gene, if the mature detector does not match the protein gene, it is determined as the normal protein gene data package, if it matches, it is considered that The abnormal data of protein gene was processed by the collaborative stimulation module, and the control module controlled by C8051F060 chip to detect the abnormal data of protein gene library. The immune module generates new protein gene sequences through an immature detector, simulates the immune mechanism of protein gene through a mature detector module, and simulates the secondary response in the abnormal data detection system of protein gene library through memory detector. The system introduces data mining technology into the detection and uses a two-level dynamic optimization algorithm to calculate the ASG similarity value of protein gene secondary structure arrangement. According to this value, the abnormal data detection of the protein gene library is realized by randomly generating protein genes, negative selection, clone selection and copying memory cells through gene expression. The experimental results show that the system can quickly detect abnormal data of the protein gene library, ensure the detection efficiency, and the detection accuracy reaches 97.1%. The system can reduce the error rate of normal protein gene detection as an abnormal protein gene.	ĠASG	 module
Biosynthesis and characterization with antimicrobial activity of TiO2 nanoparticles using probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum.	33287930	Bifidobacterium selectively colonizes the infants' intestinal tract, and the relevant coliform bacteria in adults are particularly beneficial because of their enhanced capability to prevent pathogens of gastro intestine by direct antimicrobial action and relieve infection, which led to their intensification, the antibacterial activities of titanium nanoparticles producing by some bacteria, makes them attractive as a new agent against pathogenic bacteria. In our present study, we used a probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium bifidum which was isolated from the commercial market capsule to produce TiO2 nanoparticles and study the biologically characterized nanoparticle using various techniques like Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and study its antimicrobial activity against a bacteria isolated from the stool of patients suffering from acute diarrhea. The results showed that the morphological characteristics of nanoparticles were found to have a spherical shape and mean size of 81 nm by AFM while scanning electron microscope viewed as an oval shape with anatase form synthesized by B. bifidum. TiO2-NP synthesized by B. bifidum had an inhibitory effect against P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii, K. pneumonia at a concentration 16 mg/ml and 32 mg/ml towards E. coli and S. typhi, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against pathogenic bacteria isolated from acute diarrhea included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumonia, E.coli and salmonella typhi was utilized to determine the antibacterial impact of the synthesized TIO2 nanoparticles. Our biologically synthesized titanium nanoparticles were effective against all the tested pathogenic bacteria at various degrees and had a probable role in significantly greater antimicrobial efficacy against all isolates under study. This trial may have considerable significance for the prevention of antibiotic resistance associated diarrhea in hospitals.	MIC	 minimum inhibitory concentration

Quercetin may repair the impaired oxidant-antioxidant balance in 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced cardiac injury in male rats.	33287931	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prophylactic effects of quercetin (QUE) against oxidative damages and histological changes induced by 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in rat heart. For this purpose, 20 adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups as fellow control group, TCDD group (10µg/kg BW/day by gavage daily for 60 consecutive days), QUE group (30 mg/kg BW/day) and TCDD + QUEgroup. The oxidative biomarkers of heart tissue and the levels of cTnI and lipid profile in serum were measured. Our results showed that the cTnI serum level and the heart lipid peroxidation significantly increased and the heart level of antioxidant profile significantly decreased in the TCDD group compared to control and QUEgroups. While pretreatment with QUEcould significantly improved these factors in serum and heart tissue in animals that consumed TCDD. It can be concluded that QUEat doses of 30 mg/kg/day could alleviate heart oxidative damage and histological changes induced by TCDD.	TCDD	 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin

Immunohistochemical expression of ATRX in gliomas.	33287933	Glioma is one of the primary tumors of the central nervous system that occurs in the spinal cord or brain and the origin of the tumor is from glial cell cells. The most common site of glioma tumors is the brain. Glioma accounts for 30% of all central nervous system tumors and 80% of malignant brain tumors. Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) mutations are frequently distinguished in gliomas. Current research is an attempt to assess ATRX immunoexpression in different types of gliomas diagnosed, in Erbil-Iraq, and to evaluate its association with patient's age, gender, tumor location, grade and type. From January 2015 to January 2017, we reviewed and analyzed 97 cases of glioma. Immunohistochemical staining, for ATRX, was performed using an automated immunostainer technique. According to the WHO grading system for brain tumors, 16 (16.5%) cases were grade I gliomas, 27 (27.8%) were grade II, 10 (10.3%) were anaplastic gliomas (grade III), and 44 (45.3%) cases were glioblastomas WHO (grade IV). Positive ATRX immunoexpression was demonstrated in 27 (27.8%) cases. The highest rates of ATRX expression (55.6%) were among 30-39 years' age group, supratentorial (34.2%), and among grade II and III tumors (40.7% and 30% respectively). A significant association was observed between ATRX expression and patient's age, tumor location, tumor type and grade (p-values 0.010, 0.004, 0.004, and 0.037 respectively). No significant association was found between ATRX expression and patient's gender (p-value 0.097). It was found that ATRX is frequently expressed in grade II and III astrocytomas and was significantly related to the patient's age, tumor location, type and grade, so it can be used as a good diagnostic and prognostic indicator for glioma.

Application of intravoxel incoherent motion imaging in the study of migration and movement of cancer cells.	33287934	IVIM imaging technology can obtain physiological information of tissue cells and blood perfusion at the same time in one imaging process. Taking female patients in Shenzhen Maternal and Child Health Hospital affiliated to Southern Medical University as an example, the migration and movement of breast cancer cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells are studied by intravoxel incoherent motion imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) are measured by the IVIM bi-index model, and statistical analysis is made. The results show that the IVIM bi-index model can truly reflect the diffusion of water molecules in breast mass-like lesions, and reflect the migration and movement of breast cancer cells. Especially D value has important reference significance for the research and diagnosis of breast cancer cells. IVIM bi-index model has limited diagnostic value for the migration and movement of common hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and ADC value may have higher diagnostic efficiency.

Analysis of topological properties and drug discovery for bipolar disorder and associated diseases: A bioinformatics approach.	33287935	With the advancement and development of sophisticated bioinformatics tools, the area of computational bioinformatics and systems biology analysis is expanding day by day. The bipolar or manic-depressive disorder might be characterized as one of the most crippling mental problems that affect the people of early age and grown-ups. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between genetic mutations in the four above listed diseases and to create a Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network or common pathways. Firstly, we need to find out the genetic relationship between them. Thus it will help us to understand the genetic association between them and help to develop the drug design for all the diseases. Genes responsible for these diseases are gathered, pre-processed, processed and mining using python scripts. This exploration is expected to carry out further measurements in the field of drug structure and also contributes to the biological and biomedical sectors.	PPI	 Protein-protein interaction
Identification of atrial fibrillation-related circular RNAs and constructing the integrative regulatory network of circular RNAs, microRNAs and mRNAs by bioinformatics analysis.	33287936	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with a high incidence of stroke. Many circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been demonstrated they are elated to various heart diseases and may play important roles in diagnostics or many pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, there is Few studies on circRNAs functions in persistent AF. To identify AF-related circRNAs and construct the integrative regulatory network of circular RNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, we collected human right atrial appendage tissues from 5 patients suffering persistent AF (AF group) and 5 patients with normal sinus rhythm (NSR group) and characterized the global changes in circRNA expression with high-throughput sequencing technology. The differential expression of circRNAs and the interactions between circRNAs and microRNAs were analyzed. The microRNA expression file GSE68475 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to explore the differentially expressed microRNAs. The target genes of overlapped miRNAs were predicted by using DIANA-TarBase v8. We constructed the circRNA- miRNA-mRNA network using Cytoscape (version 3.4.0) and the network topology was analyzed by utilizing CentiScaPe app. Results showed that all of 600 differentially expressed circRNAs related to AF were screened, including 340 up-regulated and 260 down-regulated circRNAs. An integrative regulatory network was constructed, which included 30 circRNAs, 9 miRNAs and 130 target mRNAs of these miRNAs. It was concluded that that 30 circRNAs, including 8 upregulated circRNAs and 22 downregulated circRNAs, were predicted to highly possibly function as sponges of 9 miRNAs to regulate gene expression by using bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, the interactions of hsa-miR-339-5p with its related circRNAs and target mRNAs constructed the hub regulatory network in persistent AF by utilizing topology analysis. Our proposed regulatory network of circRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs may provide new insight into the potential mechanism underlying persistent AF. Additionally, these important molecular may become novel biomarkers providing a new strategy in diagnosis and therapy of AF.	ĠmiRNAs	 microRNAs

Potential risk assessment of miR-143 gene polymorphisms rs41291957 and rs353292 in colorectal cancer.	33287937	Colorectal cancer is a life-threatening and therapeutically challenging disease. Increasingly it is being deciphered that genetic and epigenetic mutations play a central role in cancer onset and progression. Excitingly, discovery of non-coding RNAs is considered to be a milestone in molecular oncology and emerging evidence is deepening our understanding about pivotal role of miRNAs in carcinogenesis. miR-143 has been experimentally verified to play an instrumental role as tumor suppressor. Recent studies suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms rs41291957 and rs353292 in miR-143 may associate with the progression and or development of colorectal cancer. In present study 400 Pakistani subjects participated including 200 colorectal cancer patients and 200 age and gender matched healthy individuals. Blood samples and clinical information of the confirmed patients was collected from cancer diagnosis and treatment hospitals in Pakistan. The polymorphisms rs41291957 and rs353292 were genotyped in patients and controls by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and results were validated by Sanger sequencing. The association of the SNPs within the study group was analyzed by χ² test with p value &lt; 0.05 as significant. Odds ratio was calculated with 95% confidence interval.Genetic predisposition to cancer was observed in presence of characteristic rs45291957 polymorphism. χ² test results show strongly significant association mi-RNA rs45291957 SNP with colorectal cancer p value 0.0111 (&lt;0.05) along with the statistically significant correlation tested by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. However, no significant correlation (p value 0.6683) could be found for the association of rs353292 with colorectal cancer in Pakistani population. The present study for the first time gave evidence of miR-143 rs41291957 involvement in colorectal cancer patients of Pakistani population. This target can be a useful molecular tool for the prognosis and treatment targets for colorectal cancer in Pakistani population. rs353292 genetic association can be explored for different cancers in Pakistan to completely rule out its role in cancer.

Raddeanin A suppresses lung cancer cell proliferation via induction of apoptosis and increased production of ROS.	33287938	At present, in vitro cell experiments have confirmed that RaddeaninA can effectively inhibit the proliferation of some tumor cells, but the effect of RaddeaninA on lung cancer cells has not been observed. Therefore, this study explored its effect on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action. Human lung cancer cell lines were treated with serum-free medium and varied concentrations of Raddeanin A. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined using MTT, and flow cytometric assays, respectively. The intracellular level of ROS was determined using DCFH-DA assay. Protein and mRNA expressions of bax, bcl-2 and cyt c were measured using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RaddeaninA treatment can promote PC-9 cell apoptosis in a time and dose-dependent manner (p&lt;0.05). Treatment of PC-9 cells with Raddeanin significantly and dose-dependently increased the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (p&lt;0.05), and led to significant and dose-dependent increases in ROS levels (p&lt;0.05). Treatment of PC-9 cells with Raddeanin A led to significant and dose-dependent decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential (p&lt;0.05). It significantly and dose-dependently upregulated bax mRNA and protein expressions, but down-regulated bcl-2 mRNA and protein expressions significantly and dose-dependently (p&lt;0.05). On the other hand, Raddeanin significantly and dose-dependently down-regulated cytoplasmic bax protein expression, while upregulating cyt c expression (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, bax protein expression was significantly and dose-dependently upregulated in mitochondria, but the corresponding cyt c expression was significantly and dose-dependently down-regulated (p&lt;0.05).

miR-196a targeting LRIG3 promotes the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells.	33287939	In recent years, studies have found that miR-RNA plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. Among them, miR-196a is closely related to cervical cancer. Therefore, this experiment investigates the effect of mir-196a expression on cervical cancer cells and related mechanisms. The expression level of miR-196a in the cervical cancer cell line was assayed with the RT-PCR method, and liposome transfection was used to investigate its up-regulation or down-regulation in cervical cancer cells. The CCK-8 method and flow cytometry were used to measure cervical cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, while the Transwell assay was used to determine cell migration and invasion of each transfection group. Bioinformatics was used to predict the target gene of miR-196a, which was verified using dual luciferase report experiment and Western blot, and miR-196a was further transfected with si-LRIG3 to detect its reversal effect on miR-196a regulation. Inhibition of the expression of miR-196a significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, and promoted their apoptosis. Results from dual luciferase assay showed that miR-196a and LRIG3 had direct targeting effects. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were enhanced by a reduction in the expression level of LRIG3 protein after miR-196a inhibitor cells were transfected with si-LRIG3. The expression of miR-196a is up-regulated in cervical cancer, and it promotes the growth of cervical cancer by its targeting effect on LRIG3 expression, resulting in enhancement of the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of cervical cancer cells, and inhibition of apoptosis.

Diagnostic value of cfDNA and long fragment DNA in patients with breast cancer.	33287940	To investigate the diagnostic value of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and long fragment DNA in breast cancer patients.Female patients with breast cancer (n = 80) were recruited over one year for this study, and served as an observation group. The control group consisted of 50 normal, healthy females. Plasma levels of cfDNA and long fragment DNA were determined a day before treatment, 7 days after treatment, and on the 20th day of treatment. The levels of cfDNA and long fragment DNA in breast cancer patients before treatment were significantly higher than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). Patients cfDNA and long fragment DNA levels 7 days after treatment were not significantly different from the corresponding values at 1 day before treatment (p&gt;0.05), but they decreased significantly on the 20th day of treatment, when compared with levels before treatment (p&lt;0.05). Before treatment, the optimal cut-off point for cfDNA in patients' peripheral blood, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 12.25ng/mL, 79.12%, 86.15%, and 73.32%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.865 (95% CI = 0.754-0.903). Close monitoring of cfDNA levels in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients in real-time can be used for early diagnosis of the disease.	cfDNA)	 cell-free DNA
Fibrillin 2 gene knockdown inhibits invasion and migration of lung cancer cells.	33287941	To investigate the effect of Fibrillin 2 (FBN2) expression on the invasion and migration of lung cancer cells, and the underlying mechanism. Protein and mRNA expressions of FBN2 were assayed. The relationship between FBN2 protein expression and clinical characteristics of lung cancer patients was analyzed. Correlation between FBN2 expression level and patient survival time was analyzed. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of FBN2 in lung cancer cells and human normal lung epithelial cells were assayed. After constructing low-expressing FBN2 cells, the cell proliferation, clone formation, migration and invasion capabilities were tested. Lung cancer cells proliferation with low FBN2 expression in nude mice was measured with a nude mouse tumorigenic experiment. The mRNA and protein expressions of FBN2 in lung cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in para-cancerous tissues (p&lt;0.05).  FBN2 protein expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and histological type (p&lt;0.05). Survival time was markedly reduced in patients with high FBN2 expression (p&lt;0.001). The expressions of FBN2 mRNA and protein were markedly higher in lung cancer cells than in human normal lung epithelial cells. The proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells were significantly inhibited by FBN2 knockdown. The FBN2 knockdown significantly inhibited the protein expressions of p-FAK, p-MEK and p-ERK. FBN2 is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues, and as an oncogene, it affects the pathogenesis of lung cancer. The knockdown of the expression of FBN2 significantly inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of lung cancer cells.	FBN2	 Fibrillin 2
miR-409-3p inhibits the proliferation and migration of human ovarian cancer cells by targeting Rab10.	33287942	Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of gynecological cancer-related mortality. It has been reported that miR-409-3p is involved in the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. However, the role of miR-409-3p in ovarian cancer has not been well studied. The present study aimed to investigate the functional role of miR-409-3p in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, and its potential mechanism. It was found that the expression levels of miR-409-3p in 6 ovarian cancer tissues were upregulated. Through proliferation, migration and colony formation assays, it was revealed that overexpression of miR-409-3p inhibited the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells. It was predicted from bioinformatics assays that the complementary binding sites were within miR-409-3p and Rab10. It was also demonstrated that the downregulation of the expression of Rab10 reversed the miR-409-3p downregulation-induced abnormal proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that miR-409-3p expression can be used as a predictive marker for the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Thus, the miR-409-3p/Rab10 axis may be a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.	ĠmiR-409-3p	 cancer

Lymphocyte cell population as a potential hematological index for early diagnosis of COVID-19.	33287943	The pandemic diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are now threatening human health and survival. Early diagnosis and isolation of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is important to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigate the potential clinical utility of lymphocyte CPD for early diagnosis of COVID-19. To investigate the potential of lymphocyte cell population data (lymphocyte CPD) for use in early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lymphocyte CPD of healthy control (n = 51), common cold patients (n = 49) and mild COVID-19 patients (n = 126) were generated using hematology analyzer. The parameters were subjected to sensitivity and specificity analysis to determine their suitability as biomarkers for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Normality analysis showed that lymphocyte CPD followed a normal distribution. There were no significant differences in white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocyte (LY#) counts as well as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the groups (p &gt; 0.05). Lymphocyte volume standard deviation (LV-SD), lymphocyte conductivity standard deviation (LC-SD) and lymphocyte light scatter standard deviation (LS-SD) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in common cold and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). The corresponding mean lymphocyte light scattering  (MLS) was significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group, relative to the common cold group, but was significantly increased, when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in mean lymphocyte volume (MLV) between the COVID-19 group and the common cold or control group (p &gt; 0.05), but it was significantly higher in the common cold group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). At a cutoff value ≥ 16.38, LS-SD was more sensitive and specific than other lymphocyte CPD parameters. At a cutoff value ≥ 11.89, LC-SD achieved 84.4 % sensitivity, 87.5 % specificity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888. However, at a cutoff value ≥ 15.95, LS-SD reached 81.3 % sensitivity, 75 % specificity and an AUC of 0.876.

Investigation of regulation and mechanism of miR-223 on autophagy of CD4 + T lymphocytes in septic mice.	33287944	T-lymphocyte dysfunction is most important part of immune dysfunction in sepsis, where dynamic change, especially autophagy of CD4+T lymphocytes is found to be related to disease fate. Our study is to i nvestigate the changes of CD4 + T lymphocytes and their autophagy levels in septic miR-223 -/- mouse model injected intraperitoneally with E. coli.120 male C57BL/6J wild-type. Twenty male miR-223 knockout(miR-223-/-) mice were randomly divided into, according to intraperitoneal injection of normal saline (NS) and E. coli solution, normal saline (WT NS) group, sepsis (WT Sep) group, miR-223 -/- NS group and miR-223 -/- Sep group, respectively. The autophagy related protein was monitored with flow cytometry to observe the autophagy of CD4+T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry showed the proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood circulation, alveoli, and spleen of mice in the WT Sep group gradually decreased after surgery, the proportion of cells with autophagic activity in this population of cells was significantly higher than that in the WT NS group, and the proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes with active autophagic activity in miR-223 -/- mice were significantly decreased, but higher than that in the miR-223 -/- NS group and lower than the level of autophagy in CD4 + T cells of wild-type mice.

Investigation of regulation and mechanism of miR-223 on autophagy of CD4 + T lymphocytes in septic mice.	33287944	T-lymphocyte dysfunction is most important part of immune dysfunction in sepsis, where dynamic change, especially autophagy of CD4+T lymphocytes is found to be related to disease fate. Our study is to i nvestigate the changes of CD4 + T lymphocytes and their autophagy levels in septic miR-223 -/- mouse model injected intraperitoneally with E. coli.120 male C57BL/6J wild-type. Twenty male miR-223 knockout(miR-223-/-) mice were randomly divided into, according to intraperitoneal injection of normal saline (NS) and E. coli solution, normal saline (WT NS) group, sepsis (WT Sep) group, miR-223 -/- NS group and miR-223 -/- Sep group, respectively. The autophagy related protein was monitored with flow cytometry to observe the autophagy of CD4+T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry showed the proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood circulation, alveoli, and spleen of mice in the WT Sep group gradually decreased after surgery, the proportion of cells with autophagic activity in this population of cells was significantly higher than that in the WT NS group, and the proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes with active autophagic activity in miR-223 -/- mice were significantly decreased, but higher than that in the miR-223 -/- NS group and lower than the level of autophagy in CD4 + T cells of wild-type mice. Thus, miR-223 can up-regulate the level of autophagy in CD4 + T lymphocytes of septic mice, suggesting that miR-223 may be used as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of sepsis.

A comprehensive review of histopathological findings of infections induced by COVID-19.	33287945	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (CoV2) virus, first identified in Wuhan, China, caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which soon became a global pandemic, as labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO). The transmission method of the infection is primarily through droplets of various sizes. The SARS-CoV2 virus leads to a severe respiratory illness which in the first place causes the simulation of the acute respiratory syndrome. In order to diagnose of COVID-19 efficiently, samples with infection probability need to be examined through histopathological methods. Survival chances of the infected can remarkably increase if the virus is diagnosed timely by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. One of the destructive effects of COVID-19 is the formation of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lungs which might be regarded to be equivalent to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). COVID-19 acts very similarly to SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which can be inactivated by the chemical compounds of ethanol and sodium hypochlorite. Epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 have been indicated by numerous studies; however, there is still a lack of details of pathologic changes in the lung. The present comprehensive review is an attempt to assess and cover the current state of knowledge on COVID-19 disease based on the histopathologic studies conducted before May 2020.

Review of current pathways to wait-listing for kidney transplantation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with end-stage kidney disease in the Top End of Northern Australia.	33287946	Published evidence confirms poor access to wait-listing for kidney transplantation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians from the Northern Territory. This study aimed to identify the practical causes and recommend improvement. Pathways to wait-listing for a kidney transplant were reviewed to identify potential barriers. Processes were mapped to identify potential problem areas, provide comparison of the actual versus the ideal, identify where data needed collecting and provide clear presentation of the processes. Staff involved in the work-up of patients going for wait-listing were asked to list the barriers. Data were collected for patients from the transplant database between 1 January 2017 to 31 August 2018. Quality improvement statistical processes and charts were used to analyse and present the results. There were 102 patients in the transplant work-up process; 81.4% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, 71.6% were progressing with the work-up, 28.4% were on-hold. Of the 29 patients on hold, 92.9% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. Causes of delays to wait-listing included: failure to attend appointments due to competing priorities and communication barriers, access and navigating complex pathways to specialist services, transport, co-morbidities requiring multiple tests and multiple specialty services, and pressures on dialysis and hospital bed capacity. In conclusion, barriers to wait-listing for kidney transplantation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are complex and can be addressed by redesigning healthcare provision, including increasing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce to provide education and patient navigation of the healthcare system and improve communication, streamlining investigations and coordinating specialist services.What is known about the topic?Access to wait-listing for kidney transplantation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians from the Northern Territory is poor. Barriers to wait-listing for kidney transplantation can occur anywhere along the pathway of care from a patient's first contact with the renal service to wait-listing.What does this paper add?Identified barriers to wait-listing for kidney transplantation include health service workforce and resources shortages, patient and health service barriers such as patients' competing priorities, poor communication between the health service and patients, transport and accommodation for patients from remote communities, complex comorbidities, and access to specialist services.What are the implications for practitioners?Recruitment and retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mentors, healthcare workers and patient navigators should be prioritised to provide an effective culturally appropriate service.

Root length is proxy for high-throughput screening of waterlogging tolerance in Urochloa spp. grasses.	33287947	C4 perennial Urochloa spp. grasses are widely planted in extensive areas in the tropics. These areas are continuously facing waterlogging events, which limits plant growth and production. However, no commercial cultivar combining excellent waterlogging tolerance with superior biomass production and nutritional quality is available. The objective of this study was to identify root traits that can be used for selecting waterlogging tolerant species of Urochloa. Root respiration, root morphological, architectural and anatomical traits were evaluated in eight contrasting Urochloa spp. genotypes grown under aerated or deoxygenated stagnant solutions. Moreover, modelling of internal aeration was used to relate differences in root traits and root growth in waterlogged soils. Increased aerenchyma formation in roots, reduced stele area and development of a fully suberised exodermis are characteristics improving internal aeration of roots and therefore determining waterlogging tolerance in these C4 forage grasses. Waterlogging-tolerant genotypes had steeper root angles and greater root lengths than the waterlogging-sensitive genotypes. In stagnant conditions, waterlogging-tolerant genotypes had a greater proportion of aerenchyma and reduced stele area in root cross-sections, had deeper roots, steeper root angle and larger root biomass, which in turn, allowed for greater shoot biomass. Total root length had the strongest positive influence on shoot dry mass and can therefore be used as proxy for selecting waterlogging tolerant Urochloa genotypes.	ĠC4	 waterlogging tolerance
Is Australia.	33287948	Australia's clinical research communities responded quickly to COVID-19. Similarly, research funding to address the pandemic was appropriately fast-tracked and knowledge promptly disseminated. This swift and purposeful research response is encouraging and reflects thorough and meticulous training of the academic workforce; in particular the clinician scientist. Clinician scientists have formal clinical and research qualifications (primarily PhD), and are at the forefront of translating knowledge into health care. Yet in reality, advances in medical research are not rapid. Scientific discovery results from the long-term accumulation of knowledge. The drivers of this knowledge are often PhD students who provide new lines of clinical inquiry coupled with the advanced training of early- and mid-career researchers who sustain discovery through a clinician scientist workforce. A crucial point during these COVID-19 times is that this initial investment in training must be nurtured and maintained. Without this investment, the loss of a future generation of potential discoveries and a vibrant scientific workforce to safeguard us from future global health threats is at risk. This risk includes the modest gains achieved by increasing female and minority representation in STEM and the clinician scientist workforce. COVID-19 has presented serious concerns to Australia's health and economy. This perspective is central to these concerns and urges investment in the continuity of training and maintaining a sustainable clinician scientist workforce sufficient to address current and future pandemics, alongside continuing discoveries to improve the health of Australians.

Predawn leaf conductance depends on previous day irradiance but is not related to growth in aspen saplings grown under artificially manipulated air humidity.	33287949	Recent studies have suggested that predawn stomatal opening may enhance early-morning photosynthesis (A) and improve the relative growth rate of trees. However, the causality between night-time stomatal conductance, A, and tree growth is disputable because stomatal opening in darkness can be mediated by previous day photosynthate loads and might be a consequence of growth-related processes like dark respiration (R). To identify linkages between night-time leaf conductance (gl_night), A, R, and tree growth, we conducted an experiment in hybrid aspen saplings grown under different air relative humidity (RH) conditions and previous day irradiance level (IR_pday). Predawn leaf conductance (gl_predawn) depended on RH, IR_pday and R (P < 0.05), whereas early-morning gross A (Agross_PAR500) depended on IR_pday and gl_predawn (P < 0.001). Daytime net A was positively related to Agross_PAR500 and leaf [N] (P < 0.05). Tree diameter and height increment correlated positively with gl at the beginning and middle of the night (P < 0.05) but not before dawn. Although our results demonstrate that gl_night was related to tree growth, the relationship was not determined by R. The linkage between gl_predawn and Agross_PAR500 was modified by IR_pday, indicating that daily CO2 assimilation probably provides feedback for stomatal opening before dawn.	RH	 relative humidity
Low-level CAM photosynthesis in a succulent-leaved member of the Urticaceae, Pilea peperomioides.	33287950	Pilea peperomioides Diels (Urticaceae) is a semi-succulent herbaceous species native to south-western China that has become popular in cultivation as an ornamental plant. To investigate whether this species possesses the capacity for CAM photosynthesis, measurements were made of CO2 gas exchange and titratable acidity in plants under both well-watered and water-deficit conditions. Plants were found to assimilate CO2 almost exclusively in the light via C3 photosynthesis. However, distinct transient reductions in the rate of net nocturnal CO2 release were consistently observed during the course of the dark period, and under water-deficit conditions one plant exhibited a brief period of net nocturnal CO2 uptake, providing unequivocal evidence of CAM activity. Furthermore, nocturnal increases in titratable acidity in both leaf laminas and petioles were observed in all plants exposed to wet-dry-wet cycles. This is the first report of CAM in the family Urticaceae. The results are discussed in relation to the phylogenetic position of Pilea and the partially shaded montane habitats in which this species is typically found. An updated list of all plant families currently known to contain species with CAM is presented.	ĠCAM	 Pilea peperomioides Diels
Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) regulates the proliferation of swine Sertoli cells through P53.	33287951	Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) plays an oncogenic function by increasing cell proliferation in various cancer types. Deficiency in WIP1 expression leads to male infertility, possibly by impairing the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis. However, how WIP1 functions in the Sertoli cells to affect male reproduction remains unclear. Thus, in the present study we used a swine Sertoli cell line to investigate whether WIP1 regulated the proliferation of Sertoli cells to participate in male reproduction. The WIP1 inhibitor GSK2830371, WIP1-short interference (si) RNAs and an upstream microRNA (miR-16) were used to inhibit the expression of WIP1, after which the proliferation of swine Sertoli cells, P53 expression and the levels of P53 phosphorylation were determined. Inhibiting WIP1 expression suppressed swine Sertoli cell proliferation, increased P53 expression and increased levels of P53 phosphorylation. In addition, overexpression of miR-16 in swine Sertoli cells resulted in a decrease in WIP1 expression and increases in both P53 expression and P53 phosphorylation. Together, these findings suggest that WIP1 positively regulates the proliferation of swine Sertoli cells by inhibiting P53 phosphorylation, and the miR-16 is likely also involved by targeting WIP1.	miR-16	 microRNA

In addition, overexpression of miR-16 in swine Sertoli cells resulted in a decrease in WIP1 expression and increases in both P53 expression and P53 phosphorylation. Together, these findings suggest that WIP1 positively regulates the proliferation of swine Sertoli cells by inhibiting P53 phosphorylation, and the miR-16 is likely also involved by targeting WIP1.

Neutrophil infiltration regulates clock-gene expression to organize daily hepatic metabolism.	33287957	Liver metabolism follows diurnal fluctuations through the modulation of molecular clock genes. Disruption of this molecular clock can result in metabolic disease but its potential regulation by immune cells remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated that in steady state, neutrophils infiltrated the mouse liver following a circadian pattern and regulated hepatocyte clock-genes by neutrophil elastase (NE) secretion. NE signals through c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibiting fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and activating Bmal1 expression in the hepatocyte. Interestingly, mice with neutropenia, defective neutrophil infiltration or lacking elastase were protected against steatosis correlating with lower JNK activation, reduced Bmal1 and increased FGF21 expression, together with decreased lipogenesis in the liver. Lastly, using a cohort of human samples we found a direct correlation between JNK activation, NE levels and Bmal1 expression in the liver. This study demonstrates that neutrophils contribute to the maintenance of daily hepatic homeostasis through the regulation of the NE/JNK/Bmal1 axis.	FGF21	 fibroblast growth factor 21

The malaria parasite sheddase SUB2 governs host red blood cell membrane sealing at invasion.	33287958	Red blood cell (RBC) invasion by malaria merozoites involves formation of a parasitophorous vacuole into which the parasite moves. The vacuole membrane seals and pinches off behind the parasite through an unknown mechanism, enclosing the parasite within the RBC. During invasion, several parasite surface proteins are shed by a membrane-bound protease called SUB2. Here we show that genetic depletion of SUB2 abolishes shedding of a range of parasite proteins, identifying previously unrecognized SUB2 substrates. Interaction of SUB2-null merozoites with RBCs leads to either abortive invasion with rapid RBC lysis, or successful entry but developmental arrest. Selective failure to shed the most abundant SUB2 substrate, MSP1, reduces intracellular replication, whilst conditional ablation of the substrate AMA1 produces host RBC lysis. We conclude that SUB2 activity is critical for host RBC membrane sealing following parasite internalisation and for correct functioning of merozoite surface proteins.	RBC	 Red blood cell
Respiratory tissue-associated commensal bacteria offer therapeutic potential against pneumococcal colonization.	33287959	Under eubiotic conditions commensal microbes are known to provide a competitive barrier against invading bacterial pathogens in the intestinal tract, on the skin or on the vaginal mucosa. Here, we evaluate the role of lung microbiota in Pneumococcus colonization of the lungs. In eubiosis, the lungs of mice were dominantly colonized by Lactobacillus murinus. Differential analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing or L. murinus-specific qPCR of DNA from total organ homogenates vs.broncho alveolar lavages implicated tight association of these bacteria with the host tissue. Pure L. murinus conditioned culture medium inhibited growth and reduced the extension of pneumococcal chains. Growth inhibition in vitro was likely dependent on L. murinus-produced lactic acid, since pH neutralization of the conditioned medium aborted the antibacterial effect. Finally, we demonstrate that L. murinus provides a barrier against pneumococcal colonization in a respiratory dysbiosis model after an influenza A virus infection, when added therapeutically.

Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin.	33287975	Primary cutaneous lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a rare disease with low metastatic potential. Its morphologic and pathological features are similar to those of nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelial carcinoma. We report the case of a 60-year-old man with an infrapalpebral pearly papule, measuring 0.6 cm in diameter. The lesion was excised with a clinical hypothesis of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Histopathological analysis revealed a malignant neoplasm with syncytial arrangement of cells with vesicular nuclei, associated with dense lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry revealed cytokeratin-positive cells (AE1/AE3) and p63 protein, indicating epithelial histogenesis and squamous differentiation. A negative Epstein-Barr virus test result was achieved by immunohistochemistry. Primary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin is a differential diagnosis of lesions with prominent inflammatory infiltrates.	AE1/AE3	 cytokeratin-positive cells
Innate immunity and effector and regulatory mechanisms involved in allergic contact dermatitis.	33287973	Skin's innate immunity is the initial activator of immune response mechanisms, influencing the development of adaptive immunity. Some contact allergens are detected by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammasome NLR3. Keratinocytes participate in innate immunity and, in addition to functioning as an anatomical barrier, secrete cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-18, contributing to the development of Allergic Contact Dermatitis. Dendritic cells recognize and process antigenic peptides into T cells. Neutrophils cause pro-inflammatory reactions, mast cells induce migration/maturation of skin DCs, the natural killer cells have natural cytotoxic capacity, the γδ T cells favor contact with hapten during the sensitization phase, and the innate lymphoid cells act in the early stages by secreting cytokines, as well as act in inflammation and tissue homeostasis. The antigen-specific inflammation is mediated by T cells, and each subtype of T cells (Th1/Tc1, Th2/Tc2, and Th17/Tc17) activates resident skin cells, thus contributing to inflammation. Skin's regulatory T cells have a strong ability to inhibit the proliferation of hapten-specific T cells, acting at the end of the Allergic Contact Dermatitis response and in the control of systemic immune responses. In this review, we report how cutaneous innate immunity is the first line of defense and focus its role in the activation of the adaptive immune response, with effector response induction and its regulation.

Oral mucosa lesions as atypical manifestation of adult-onset Still's disease.	33287980	Adult-onset Still's disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by skin rash, spiking fever, arthralgias or arthritis, and leukocytosis. The typical skin rash is evanescent, salmon-pink, nonpruritic and maculopapular, predominantly on the extremities. It is considered one of the major Yamaguchi's criteria in adult-onset Still's disease. However, atypical skin lesions are also described. Here, a 61-year-old woman with sore throat, spiking fever, polyarthritis and evanescent salmon-pink nonpruritic maculopapular skin rash on the extremities was diagnosed with adult-onset Still's disease. In addition, atypical brown macules on oral mucosa, localized on the inner lips and tongue were also observed. Biopsy revealed a neutrophilic infiltrate.

Diphencyprone as a therapeutic option in cutaneous metastasis of melanoma. A single-institution experience.	33287990	Diphencyprone has been reported as a local immunotherapy for cutaneous melanoma metastases. We aim to report cases of melanoma patients treated with diphencyprone in a single Brazilian institution and highlight their outcomes. Since 2012, we have treated 16 melanoma patients with cutaneous metastases with topical diphencyprone. To date, we have had 37.5% of complete response, 25% of partial responses, and 31.25% patients without any response. Treatment was well tolerated and local toxicity was easily controlled. We believe topical diphencyprone is a feasible treatment that can be another option for treating melanoma patients, especially in cases of in-transit or extensive disease.	Ġin-transit	 response
Vitiligo patients show significant up-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor.	33287991	IL-22 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of IL-22-producing Th22 cells is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of aryl hydrocarbon receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with vitiligo and in normal controls. Transcript levels were determined by a reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor mRNA expression was drastically increased in patients with vitiligo compared to healthy controls (P = 0.000). Th22 cells may contribute to abnormal immune responses underlying vitiligo.	ĠIL-22-producingĠTh22	l hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor
GhVLN4 is involved in multiple stress responses and required for resistance to Verticillium wilt.	33287998	As structural and signaling platform in plant cell, the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by diverse actin binding proteins (ABPs). Villins are one type of major ABPs responsible for microfilament bundling, which have proved to play important roles in plant growth and development. However, the function of villins in stress tolerance is poorly understood. Here, we report the function of cotton GhVLN4 in Verticillium wilt resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. The expression of GhVLN4 was up-regulated by gibberellin, ethylene, ABA, salicylic acid, jasmonate, NaCl, PEG, and Verticillium dahliae treatment, suggesting the involvement of GhVLN4 in multiple stress and hormone responses and signaling. Virus-induced gene silencing GhVLN4 made cotton more susceptible to V. dahliae characterized by the preferential colonization and rapid growth of the fungus in both phloem and xylem of the infected stems. Arabidopsis overexpressing GhVLN4 exhibited higher resistance to V. dahliae, salt and drought than the wild-type plants. The enhanced resistance to V. dahliae is likely related to the upregulated components in SA signaling pathway; the improved tolerance to salt and drought is characterized by upregulation of the components both in ABA- related and ABA-independent signal pathways, along with altered stomatal aperture under drought. Our findings demonstrate that GhVLN4 may play important roles in regulating plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses.	ABPs	 actin binding proteins
Mg deficiency induces photo-oxidative stress primarily by limiting CO2 assimilation and not by limiting photosynthetic light utilization.	33287999	Photosynthetic processes within chloroplasts require substantial amounts of magnesium (Mg). It is suggested that the minimum Mg concentration for yield and dry matter (DM) formation is 1.5 mg g-1 DM. Yet, it was never clarified whether this amount is required for photosynthetic processes as well. The aim of this study was to determine how varying Mg concentrations affect the photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotective responses. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown under four different Mg supplies (1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.015 mM Mg) for 21 days to investigate the photosynthetic and photoprotective responses to Mg deficiency. Leaf Mg concentrations, CO2 assimilation, photosystem II efficiency, electron transport rate, photochemical and non-photochemical quenching, expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, and the pigment composition were analyzed. Our data indicate that CO2 assimilation is more sensitive to the reduction of tissue Mg concentrations than photosynthetic light reactions. Moreover, supply with the two lowest Mg concentrations induced photo-oxidative stress, as could be derived from increased expression of ROS scavengers and an increased pool size of the xanthophyll cycle pigments. We hypothesize, that the reduction of CO2 assimilation is a critical determinant for the increase of photo-oxidative stress under Mg deficiency.	ROS	 reactive oxygen species

Maize bHLH55 functions positively in salt tolerance through modulation of AsA biosynthesis by directly regulating GDP-mannose pathway genes.	33288001	Ascorbic acid (AsA) is an antioxidant and enzyme co-factor that is vital to plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. However, the regulation mechanisms of AsA biosynthesis in plants remain poorly understood. Here, we report a basic helix-loop-helix 55 (ZmbHLH55) transcription factor that regulates AsA biosynthesis in maize. Analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data revealed that ZmbHLH55 is co-expressed with several genes of the GDP-mannose pathway. Experimental data showed that ZmbHLH55 forms homodimers localized to the cell nuclei, and it exhibits DNA binding and transactivation activity in yeast. Under salt stress conditions, knock down mutant (zmbhlh55) in maize accumulated lower levels of AsA compared with wild type, accompanied by lower antioxidant enzymes activity, shorter root length, and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Gene expression data from the WT and zmbhlh55 mutant, showed that ZmbHLH55 positively regulates the expression of ZmPGI2, ZmGME1, and ZmGLDH, but negatively regulates ZmGMP1 and ZmGGP. Furthermore, ZmbHLH55-overexpressing Arabidopsis, under salt conditions, showed higher AsA levels, increased rates of germination, and elevated antioxidant enzyme activities. In conclusion, these results have identified previously unknown regulation mechanisms for AsA biosynthesis, indicating that ZmbHLH55 may be a potential candidate to enhance plant salt stress tolerance in the future.

The lotus NnFTIP1 and NnFT1 regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis.	33288002	In higher plants, floral signals are mainly collected and transduced to FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and its orthologues. The movement of FT from leaves to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is partially mediated by FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (FTIP1). Although the functions of OsFTIP1 in rice and DOFTIP1 in orchid in FT transport have also been investigated, the FTIP1 homologue in lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.), a type of horticultural plant with high economic and cultural value, has not been isolated, and the mechanism of NnFT1 transport has not been explored. Here, we revealed that NnFTIP1 mediates the transport of NnFT1 in ectopic transgenic lines in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of NnFTIP1 in the ftip1-1 background rescued the late flowering phenotype of ftip1-1, indicating that NnFTIP1 has a conserved function as FTIP1. NnFTIP1 and NnFT1 share similar tissue expression patterns and subcellular localization. NnFTIP1 and NnFT1 interact both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, NnFTIP1 affects NnFT1 transport from leaves to the SAM. Furthermore, we found that NnUOF8, a MYB-like transcription factor, directly regulates the expression of NnFTIP1. Our results suggest that the functions of FTIP1 and FT are conserved during evolution in flowering plants.	FTIP1	INTERACTING PROTEIN1

Roles of CsBRC1-like in leaf and lateral branch development in cucumber.	33288003	TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) family genes, as plant-specific transcription factors, play vital roles in flower pattern, leaf development and plant architecture. Our recent study shows that the TCP gene BRANCHED1 (CsBRC1) specifically regulates shoot branching in cucumber. Here, we found CsBRC1 had a closely related paralogous gene CsBRC1-like. The synteny analysis revealed that these two genes originated from a segmental duplication. CsBRC1-like displayed different expression patterns in cucumber compared with CsBRC1, indicating that they may have functional differentiation. Ectopic expression of CsBRC1-like in Arabidopsis brc1-1 mutant resulted in reduced rosette branches and rosette leaves, whereas silencing CsBRC1-like in cucumber only led to a deformed true leaf of seedling rather than affecting the shoot branching. RNA-seq analysis of wild-type and CsBRC1-like-RNAi plants implicated that CsBRC1-like might regulate early leaf development through affecting the transcripts of auxin and cytokinin related genes in cucumber. Moreover, CsBRC1-like directly interacts with CsTCP10a and CsBRC1 in vivo. Our results demonstrated that CsBRC1-like has a specific role in regulating leaf development, and CsBRC1-like and CsBRC1 may have overlapping roles in shoot branching.

Chlorophyll dephytylation in chlorophyll metabolism: a simple reaction catalyzed by various enzymes.	33288004	Chlorophyll (Chl) is composed of a tetrapyrrole ring and a phytol tail, which facilitate light energy absorbance and assembly with photosynthetic protein complexes, respectively. Chl dephytylation, the hydrolytic removal of the phytol tail, is considered a pivotal step in diverse physiological processes, such as Chl salvage during repair of the photosystem, the Chl cycle in the adjustment of antenna size, and Chl breakdown in leaf senescence and fruit maturation. Moreover, phytol is a component of the tocopherols, a major form of vitamin E that is essential in the human diet. This phytol mostly comes from Chl hydrolysis. However, the authentic enzyme responsible for Chl dephytylation has proved elusive. CHLOROPHYLLASE (CLH) which was discovered over a century ago, was the first enzyme found to have dephytylation activity in vitro, but its role in Chl metabolism has been questioned and remains under debate. Recently, novel dephytylases, i.e., PHEOPHYTINASE (PPH) and CHLOROPHYLL DEPHYTYLASE1 (CLD1) have emerged from genetic studies, indicating that dephytylation in Chl catabolism involves different players and is more complicated than previously thought. Based on sequence homology, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization, CLH, PPH, and CLD1 belong to different types of dephytylase, which prompted us to re-examine the dilemmas and missing links that still exist in Chl metabolism. This review thus focuses on the hitherto unanswered questions involving the Chl dephytylation reaction by highlighting relevant literature, updating recent progress, and synthesizing ideas.

Moreover, phytol is a component of the tocopherols, a major form of vitamin E that is essential in the human diet. This phytol mostly comes from Chl hydrolysis. However, the authentic enzyme responsible for Chl dephytylation has proved elusive. CHLOROPHYLLASE (CLH) which was discovered over a century ago, was the first enzyme found to have dephytylation activity in vitro, but its role in Chl metabolism has been questioned and remains under debate. Recently, novel dephytylases, i.e., PHEOPHYTINASE (PPH) and CHLOROPHYLL DEPHYTYLASE1 (CLD1) have emerged from genetic studies, indicating that dephytylation in Chl catabolism involves different players and is more complicated than previously thought. Based on sequence homology, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization, CLH, PPH, and CLD1 belong to different types of dephytylase, which prompted us to re-examine the dilemmas and missing links that still exist in Chl metabolism. This review thus focuses on the hitherto unanswered questions involving the Chl dephytylation reaction by highlighting relevant literature, updating recent progress, and synthesizing ideas.

Rhamnose in plants - from biosynthesis to diverse functions.	33288005	In plants, the deoxy sugar l-rhamnose is widely present as rhamnose-containing polymers in cell walls and as part of the decoration of various specialized metabolites. Here, we review the current knowledge on the distribution of rhamnose, highlighting the differences between what is known in dicotyledoneuos compared to commelinid monocotyledoneous (grasses) plants. We discuss the biosynthesis and transport of UDP-rhamnose, as well as the transfer of rhamnose from UDP-rhamnose to various primary and specialized metabolites. This is carried out by rhamnosyltransferases, enzymes that can use a large variety of substrates. Some unique characteristics of rhamnose synthases, the multifunctional enzymes responsible for the conversion of UDP-glucose into UDP-rhamnose, are considered, particularly from the perspective of their ability to convert glucose present in flavonoids. Finally, we discuss how little is still known with regards to how plants rescue rhamnose from the many compounds to which it is linked, or how rhamnose is catabolized.	ĠUDP-glucose	 rhamnose

Improvement of production yield and extraction efficacy of recombinant protein by high endosperm-specific expression along with simultaneous suppression of major seed storage proteins.	33288006	Human transforming growth factor-β1 (hTGF-β1)　was produced in transgenic rice seeds. To boost its production yield and to extract it simply, it was expressed under the control of seed-specific promoters along with the simultaneous suppression of endogenous seed storage proteins　(SSPs)　through RNA interference (RNAi). When driven by the 26 kDa α-globulin endosperm-specific promoter, it accumulated up to the markedly high level of 452 μg/grain. However, exchange with other seed-specific promoters such as 18 kDa oleosin and AGPase promoters resulted in remarkable reduction to the levels of 62 and 48 μg/grain, respectively, even though endogenous SSPs were reduced to the similar level. These production levels were almost similar to those (42 and 108 μg/grain) produced by the glutelin GluB-1 endosperm-specific promoter and the maize ubiquitin constitutive promoter without reduction of SSPs, respectively. When extracted from these transgenic rice seeds with reduced SSPs with various buffers, it could be solubilized with denaturant solution, which was in remarkable contrast with those without depressed SSPs which required further supplementation of reducing agent for extraction. This difference was associated with the fact that it was mainly deposited to ER-derived structures though self-aggregation or interaction with remaining prolamin via intermolecular disulfide bonds.

The TaCslA12 gene expressed in the wheat grain endosperm synthesizes wheat-like mannan when expressed in yeast and Arabidopsis.	33288007	Mannan is a class of cell wall polysaccharides widespread in the plant kingdom. Mannan structure and properties vary according to species and organ. The cell walls of cereal grains have been extensively studied due to their role in cereal processing and to their beneficial effect on human health as dietary fiber. Recently, we showed that mannan in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain endosperm has a linear structure of β-1,4-linked mannose residues. The aim of this work was to study the biosynthesis and function of wheat grain mannan. We showed that mannan is deposited in the endosperm early during grain development, and we identified candidate mannan biosynthetic genes expressed in the endosperm. The functional study in wheat was unsuccessful therefore our best candidate genes were expressed in heterologous systems. The endosperm-specificTaCslA12 gene expressed in Pichia pastoris and in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant depleted in glucomannan led to the production of wheat-like linear mannan lacking glucose residues and with moderate acetylation. Therefore, this gene encodes a mannan synthase and is likely responsible for the synthesis of wheat endosperm mannan.	Ġendosperm-specificTaCslA12	 mannan
Apple TIME FOR COFFEE contributes to freezing tolerance by promoting unsaturation of fatty acids.	33288008	Freezing stress is a major environmental factor that threatens the growth and development of fruit trees. MdMYB88 and its paralogue MdMYB124 have been identified as pivotal regulators in apple (Malus × domestica) freezing stress tolerance. Here, we demonstrated that a target of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124, TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC), contributes to freezing tolerance in apple. MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 directly bound the MdTIC promoter and positively regulated its expression under cold conditions. MdTIC RNAi plants displayed reduced freezing tolerance when MdTIC expression was repressed. Moreover, MdTIC RNAi plants lowered antioxidant enzyme activity. Transcriptome profiling revealed altered expression of cold-responsive genes in MdTIC RNAi plants under cold conditions, including MdPLC2, MdMKK2, and MdICE1. We also discovered that disordered MdTIC expression changed the saturation of fatty acids. Taken together, our data suggest that MdTIC is required for apple to tolerate freezing by mediating the expression of cold-responsive genes and fatty acid composition.	TIC	 TIME FOR COFFEE
Functional characterization of SmMYB86, a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.).	33288009	Anthocyanins are a group of secondary metabolites that protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. The research on anthocyanins has been well-received due to their colorfulness and human health benefits. In this study, we used the photosensitive eggplant cultivar 'Lanshan Hexian' as the research material and reported the functional characterization of SmMYB86, a negative regulator involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis in eggplant. Our results suggested that SmMYB86 was a nuclear protein that was particularly expressed in leaves, stems, and peels. Overexpression of SmMYB86 in eggplant indicated that the accumulation of anthocyanins was reduced. Silencing of SmMYB86 in eggplant fruit peel significantly increased the anthocyanin content and expression levels of SmCHS, SmF3H, and SmANS. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays showed that SmMYB86 could directly bind to the promoters of SmCHS, SmF3H, and SmANS and suppress their activities. SmTTG1 binded to the promoter of SmCHS and promoted its activating. SmMYB86 interacted with SmTTG1 and inhibited its promotive role in SmCHS expression. This study provides some insights into the regulatory roles of SmMYB86 on key structural genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway in eggplant.	ĠSmANS	 nuclear
Advances and perspectives in the metabolomics of stomatal movement and the disease triangle.	33288010	"Crops are continuously exposed to microbial pathogens that cause tremendous yield losses worldwide. Stomatal pores formed by pairs of specialized guard cells in the leaf epidermis represent a major route of pathogen entry. Guard cells have an essential role as a first line of defense against pathogens. Metabolomics is an indispensable systems biology tool that has facilitated discovery and functional studies of metabolites that regulate stomatal movement in response to pathogens and other environmental factors. Guard cells, pathogens and environmental factors constitute the ""stomatal disease triangle"". The aim of this review is to highlight recent advances toward understanding the stomatal disease triangle in the context of newly discovered signaling molecules, hormone crosstalk, and consequent molecular changes that integrate pathogens and environmental sensing into stomatal immune responses. Future perspectives on emerging single-cell studies, multiomics and molecular imaging in the context of stomatal defense are discussed. Advances in this important area of plant biology will inform rational crop engineering and breeding for enhanced stomatal defense without disruption of other pathways that impact crop yield."

Identification and characterization of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase CpCCT1 in the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum.	33288011	Phosphatidylcholine is a major phospholipid which is shown to be involved in stress adaptation. Phosphatidylcholine increased during dehydration in Craterostigma plantagineum, and therefore we characterized CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CpCCT1), a key regulatory enzyme for phosphatidylcholine synthesis in plants. The CpCCT1 gene from the resurrection plant C. plantagineum was cloned and the amino acid sequence was compared with homologs from other species including yeast and rat. CCT proteins have conserved catalytic and membrane-binding domains while the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have diverged. The tissue specific expression analysis indicated that CpCCT1 is expressed in all tested tissues and it is induced by dehydration and in response to 0.5 M NaCl solutions. In plants exposed to low temperature in the dark, the CpCCT1 transcript increased after 4 h at 4 °C. CpCCT1 expression also increased during mannitol and sorbitol treatments in a concentration dependent manner. Phytohormones such as abscisic acid and indole-3-acetic acid also trigged transcript accumulation. Comparisons of transcript and protein accumulations for different treatments (except for dehydration) suggest transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. Analysis of promoter activity and polysome occupancy suggest that CpCCT1 gene expression is mainly under translational regulation during dehydration.	1	T

DcABF3, an ABF transcription factor from carrot, alters stomatal density and reduces ABA sensitivity in transgenic Arabidopsis.	33288012	Abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) are important transcription factors involved in various physiological processes in plants. Stomata are micro channels for water and gas exchange of plants. Previous researches have demonstrated that ABFs can modulate the stomatal development in some plants. However, little is known about stomata-related functions of ABFs in carrots. In our study, DcABF3, a gene encoding for ABF transcription factor, was isolated from carrot. The open reading frame of DcABF3 was 1329 bp, encoding 442 amino acids. Expression profiles of DcABF3 indicated that DcABF3 can respond to drought, salt or ABA treatment in carrots. Overexpressing DcABF3 in Arabidopsis led to the increase of stomatal density which caused severe water loss. Expression assay indicated that overexpression of DcABF3 caused high expression of stomatal development-related transcription factor genes, SPCH, FAMA, MUTE and SCRMs. Increased antioxidant enzyme activities and higher expression levels of stress-related genes were also found in transgenic lines after water deficit treatment. Changes in expression of ABA synthesis-related genes and AtABIs indicated the potential role of DcABF3 in ABA signaling pathway. Under the treatment of exogenous ABA, DcABF3-overexpression Arabidopsis seedlings exhibited increased root length and germination rate. Our findings demonstrated that heterologous overexpression of DcABF3 positively affected stomatal development and also reduced ABA sensitivity in transgenic Arabidopsis.

β-1,3-Glucanases and chitinases participate in the stress-related defence mechanisms that are possibly connected with modulation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGP) required for the androgenesis initiation in rye (Secale cereale L.).	33288013	This work presents the biochemical, cytochemical and molecular studies on two groups of PR proteins, β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases, and the arabinogalactan proteins (AGP) during the early stages of androgenesis induction in two breeding lines of rye (Secale cereale L.) with different androgenic potential. The process of androgenesis was initiated by tillers pre-treatments with low temperature, mannitol and/or reduced glutathione and resulted in microspores reprogramming and formation of androgenic structures what was associated with high activity of β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases. Some isoforms of β-1,3-glucanases, namely several acidic isoforms of about 26 kDa; appeared to be anther specific. Chitinases were well represented but were less variable. RT-qPCR revealed that the cold-responsive chitinase genes Chit1 and Chit2 were expressed at a lower level in the microspores and whole anthers while the cold-responsive Glu2 and Glu3 were not active. The stress pre-treatments modifications promoted the AGP accumulation. An apparent dominance of some AGP epitopes (LM2, JIM4 and JIM14) was detected in the androgenesis-responsive rye line. An abundant JIM13 epitopes in the vesicles and inner cell walls of the microspores and in the cell walls of the anther cell layers appeared to be the most specific for embryogenesis.

MdKNOX19, a class II knotted-like transcription factor of apple, plays roles in ABA signalling/sensitivity by targeting ABI5 during organ development.	33288014	The ABI5 transcription factor, which is a core component of the ABA signaling pathway, affects various plant processes, including seed development and germination and responses to environmental cues. The knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor has crucial functions related to plant development, including the regulation of various hormones. In this study, an ABA-responsive KNOX gene, MdKNOX19, was identified in apple (Malus domestica). The overexpression of MdKNOX19 increased the ABA sensitivity of apple calli, resulting in a dramatic up-regulation in the transcription of the Arabidopsis ABI5-like MdABI5 gene. Additionally, MdKNOX19 overexpression in Micro-Tom adversely affected fruit size and seed yield as well as enhanced ABA sensitivity and up-regulated SlABI5 transcription during seed germination and early seedling development. An examination of MdKNOX19-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants also revealed severe defects in seed development and up-regulated expression of ABA-responsive genes. Furthermore, we further confirmed that MdKNOX19 binds directly to the MdABI5 promoter to activate expression. Our findings suggest MdKNOX19 is a positive regulator of ABI5 expression, and the conserved module MdKNOX19-MdABI5-ABA may contribute to organ development.	KNOX	 knotted1-like homeobox
Overexpression of Pti4, Pti5, and Pti6 in tomato promote plant defense and fruit ripening.	33288015	Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) is a pathogenic microorganism that causes bacterial speck disease and affects tomato yield and quality. Pto is a disease resistant gene for plant to recognize and defense against Pst. Pto interacts with Pti (Pto interacting) proteins, which include three transcription factors, Pti4, Pti5, Pti6, and they were thought to be downstream of Pto-mediated pathway to promote the expression of disease-related genes. In the present work, the overexpression plants of Pti4, Pti5 or Pti6 were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in tomato. The Pti4/5/6-overexpressed lines indicated enhanced expression of pathogenesis-related genes and resistance to pathogenic bacteria Pst DC3000. Meanwhile, the transgenic plants showed that Pti4/5/6 function in ripening but performed no obvious adverse influence on flowering time, seed-setting rate, weight and soluble solids content of fruits. Furthermore, Pti-overexpressed fruits exhibited increased enzymatic activities of phenylalnine ammonialyase, catalase, peroxidase and decreased content of malondialdehyde. Additionally, cell-free and in vivo ubiquitination assay indicated that Pti4, Pti5 and Pti6 degraded by 26S proteasome which suggested that these Pti transcription regulators' functions could be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated post translational regulation in tomato.

Sucrose signaling in higher plants.	33288016	Sucrose controls various developmental and metabolic processes in plants. In this review, we evaluate whether sucrose could be a preferred signaling molecule that controls processes like carbohydrate metabolism, accumulation of storage proteins, sucrose transport, anthocyanin accumulation, and floral induction. We summarize putative sucrose-dependent signaling pathways. Sucrose, but not other sugars, stimulates the genes that encode ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granule-bound starch synthase I, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in several species. The class-1 patatin promoter is induced under high sucrose conditions in potato (Solanum tuberosum). Exogenous sucrose reduces the loading of sucrose to the phloem by inhibiting the expression of the sucrose transporter and its protein activity in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Sucrose also influences a wide range of growth processes, including cell division, ribosome synthesis, cotyledon development, far-red light signaling, and tuber development. Floral induction is promoted by sucrose in several species. The molecular mechanisms by which sucrose functions as a signal are largely unknown. Sucrose enhances the expression of transcription factors such as AtWRKY20 and MYB75, which function upstream of the sucrose-responsive genes. Sucrose controls the expression of AtbZIP11 at the post-transcriptional level by the peptide encoded by uORF2. Sucrose levels affect translation of a group of mRNAs in Arabidopsis. Sucrose increases the activity of AGPase by posttranslational redox-modification. Sucrose interrupts the interaction between sucrose transporter SUT4 and cytochrome b5. In addition, the SNF-related protein kinase-1 appears to be involved in sucrose-dependent pathways by controlling sucrose synthase (SUS4) expression.	SUS4	 sucrose synthase

Heterologous expression of the Limonium bicolor MYB transcription factor LbTRY in Arabidopsis thaliana increases salt sensitivity by modifying root hair development and osmotic homeostasis.	33288017	Arabidopsis thaliana TRY is a negative regulator of trichome differentiation that promotes root hair differentiation. Here, we established that LbTRY, from the recretohalophyte Limonium bicolor, is a typical MYB transcription factor that exhibits transcriptional activation activity and locates in nucleus. By in situ hybridization in L. bicolor, LbTRY may be specifically positioned in salt gland of the expanded leaves. LbTRY expression was the highest in mature leaves and lowest under NaCl treatment. For functional assessment, we heterologously expressed LbTRY in wild-type and try29760 mutant Arabidopsis plants. Epidermal differentiation was remarkably affected in the transgenic wild-type line, as was increased root hair development. Complementation of try29760 with LbTRY under both 35S and LbTRY specific promoter restored the wild-type phenotype. qRT-PCR analysis suggested that AtGL3 and AtZFP5 promote root hair cell fate in lines heterologously producing LbTRY. In addition, four genes (AtRHD6, AtRSL1, AtLRL2, and AtLRL3) involved in root hair initiation and elongation were upregulated in the transgenic lines. Furthermore, LbTRY specifically increased the salt sensitivity of the transgenic lines. The transgenic and complementation lines showed poor germination rates and reduced root lengths, whereas the mutant unexpectedly fared the best under a range of NaCl treatments. Under salt stress, the transgenic seedlings accumulated more MDA and Na+ and less proline and soluble sugar than try29760. Thus, when heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis, LbTRY participates in hair development, similar to other MYB proteins, and specifically reduces salt tolerance by increasing ion accumulation and reducing osmolytes. The expression of salt-tolerance marker genes (SOS1, SOS2, SOS3 and P5CS1) was significant reduced in the transgenic lines. More will be carried by downregulating expression of TRY homologs in crops to improve salt tolerance.	ĠTRY	-

Expression genome-wide association study identifies that phosphatidylinositol-derived signalling regulates ALUMINIUM SENSITIVE3 expression under aluminium stress in the shoots of Arabidopsis thaliana.	33288018	To identify unknown regulatory mechanisms leading to aluminium (Al)-induction of the Al tolerance gene ALS3, we conducted an expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS) for ALS3 in the shoots of 95 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions in the presence of Al. The eGWAS was conducted using a mixed linear model with 145,940 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the association results were validated using reverse genetics. We found that many SNPs from the eGWAS were associated with genes related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism as well as stress signal transduction, including Ca2+signals, inter-connected in a co-expression network. Of these, PLC9, CDPK32, ANAC071, DIR1, and a hypothetical protein (AT4G10470) possessed amino acid sequence/ gene expression level polymorphisms that were significantly associated with ALS3 expression level variation. Furthermore, T-DNA insertion mutants of PLC9, CDPK32, and ANAC071 suppressed shoot ALS3 expression in the presence of Al. This study clarified the regulatory mechanisms of ALS3 expression in the shoot and provided genetic evidence of the involvement of phosphatidylinositol-derived signal transduction under Al stress.

The eGWAS was conducted using a mixed linear model with 145,940 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the association results were validated using reverse genetics. We found that many SNPs from the eGWAS were associated with genes related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism as well as stress signal transduction, including Ca2+signals, inter-connected in a co-expression network. Of these, PLC9, CDPK32, ANAC071, DIR1, and a hypothetical protein (AT4G10470) possessed amino acid sequence/ gene expression level polymorphisms that were significantly associated with ALS3 expression level variation. Furthermore, T-DNA insertion mutants of PLC9, CDPK32, and ANAC071 suppressed shoot ALS3 expression in the presence of Al. This study clarified the regulatory mechanisms of ALS3 expression in the shoot and provided genetic evidence of the involvement of phosphatidylinositol-derived signal transduction under Al stress.	eGWAS	 expression genome-wide association study

Glycyrrhizin, the active compound of the TCM drug Gan Cao stimulates actin remodelling and defence in grapevine.	33288019	Actin remodelling by a membrane-associated oxidative process can sense perturbations of membrane integrity and activate defence. In the current work, we show that glycyrrhizin, a muscle relaxant used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, can activate oxidative burst and actin remodelling in tobacco BY-2 cells, which could be suppressed by diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases. Glycyrrhizin caused a dose-dependent delay of proliferation, and induced cell death, which was suppressed by addition of indole-acetic acid, a natural auxin that can mitigate RboH dependent actin remodelling. To test, whether the actin remodelling induced by glycyrrhizin was followed by activation of defence, several events of basal immunity were probed. We found that glycyrrhizin induced a transient extracellular alkalinisation, indicative of calcium influx. Furthermore, transcripts of phytoalexins genes, were activated in cells of the grapevine Vitis rupestris, and this induction was followed by accumulation of the glycosylated stilbene α-piceid. We also observed that glycyrrhizin was able to induce actin bundling in leaves of a transgenic grape, especially in guard cells. We discuss these data in frame of a model, where glycyrrhizin, through stimulation of RboH, can cause actin remodelling, followed by defence responses, such as calcium influx, induction of phytoalexins transcripts, and accumulation of stilbene glycosides.

Silencing ATG6 and PI3K accelerates petal senescence and reduces flower number and shoot biomass in petunia.	33288020	Petal senescence is a form of developmental programmed cell death (PCD) that is regulated by internal and environmental signals. Autophagy, a metabolic pathway that regulates intercellular nutrient recycling, is thought to play an important role in the regulation of petal senescence-associated PCD. To characterize the function of two central autophagy genes in petal senescence, we down-regulated Autophagy Gene 6 (PhATG6) and Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PhPI3K) using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) in Petunia × hybrida. The silencing of PhATG6 and PhPI3K accelerated petal senescence, thereby reducing flower longevity. Both PhATG6- and PhPI3K-silenced petunias had reduced flower numbers, flower biomass, and vegetative shoot biomass. These phenotypes were intensified when plants were grown under low nutrient conditions. Additionally, two important regulators of senescence, an ethylene biosynthesis gene (PhACS) and a type I metacaspase gene (PhMC1), were suppressed in senescing petals of PhATG6- and PhPI3K-silenced plants. In conclusion, our study identified PhATG6 and PhPI3K as negative regulators of flower senescence and demonstrated the influence of nutrient limitation on the function of autophagy during petal senescence. Our study also found that autophagy genes potentially influence the transcriptional regulation of metacaspases and ethylene biosynthetic genes during petal senescence. The results of this project will be fundamental for future studies of petal senescence and will provide genetic information for future crop improvement.	PhPI3K	 Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase

Genetic basis of vascular bundle variations in rice revealed by genome-wide association study.	33288021	The vascular bundles play important roles in transportation of photoassimilate, and the number, size, and capacity of vascular bundles influence the transportation efficiency. Dissecting the genetic basis may help to make better use of naturally occurring vascular bundle variations. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the vascular bundle variations in a worldwide collection of 529 Oryza sativa accessions. A total of 42 and 93 significant association loci were identified in the neck panicle and flag leaf, respectively. The introgression lines showing extreme values of the target traits harbored at least one GWAS signal, indicating the reliability of the GWAS loci. Based on the data of near-isogenic lines and transgenic plants, Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) was identified as a major locus for the natural variation of vascular bundles in the neck panicle at the heading stage. In addition, Narrow leaf1 (NAL1) was found to influence the vascular bundles in both the neck panicle and flag leaf, and the effects of the major haplotypes of NAL1 were characterized. The loci or candidate genes identified would help to improve vascular bundle system in rice breeding.	GWAS	 genome-wide association study
Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice.	33288022	Anther development is a complex process regulated by a myriad of transcription factors belonging to distinct protein families. In this study, we focus on the functional characterization of OsbHLH35, a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) TF that regulates anther development in rice. Plants overexpressing OsbHLH35 presented small and curved anthers, leading to a reduction of 72 % on seed production. Rice transgenic plants expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of OsbHLH35 promoter (pOsbHLH35::GUS) showed that this TF specifically accumulates in anthers at the meiosis stage and in other spikelet tissues. Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35. Transactivation assay showed that OsGRF11 negatively regulates OsbHLH35 expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. This regulation was also observed in planta through the analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF11 (OsGRF11OE), confirming that OsGRF11 is a negative regulator of OsbHLH35 in rice. Our data suggest that OsbHLH35 plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production.	GRF	 Growth-Regulating Factor

The growth of Arabidopsis primary root is repressed by several and diverse amino acids through auxin-dependent and independent mechanisms and MPK6 kinase activity.	33288023	Amino acids serve as structural monomers for protein synthesis and are considered important biostimulants for plants. In this report, the effects of all 20-L amino acids in Arabidopsis primary root growth were evaluated. 15 amino acids inhibited growth, being l-leucine (l-Leu), l-lysine (l-Lys), l-tryptophan (l-Trp), and l-glutamate (l-Glu) the most active, which repressed both cell division and elongation in primary roots. Comparisons of DR5:GFP expression and growth of WT Arabidopsis seedlings and several auxin response mutants including slr, axr1 and axr2 single mutants, arf7/arf19 double mutant and tir1/afb2/afb3 triple mutant, treated with inhibitory concentrations of l-Glu, l-Leu, l-Lys and l-Trp revealed gene-dependent, specific changes in auxin response. In addition, l- isomers of Glu, Leu and Lys, but not l-Trp diminished the GFP fluorescence of pPIN1::PIN1:GFP, pPIN2::PIN2:GFP, pPIN3::PIN3:GFP and pPIN7::PIN7:GFP constructs in root tips. MPK6 activity in roots was enhanced by amino acid treatment, being greater in response to l-Trp while mpk6 mutants supported cell division and elongation at high doses of l-Glu, l-Leu, l-Lys and l-Trp. We conclude that independently of their auxin modulating properties, amino acids signals converge in MPK6 to alter the Arabidopsis primary root growth.	l-Glu	glutamate

Structure-function relationship of Gossypium hirsutum NAC transcription factor, GhNAC4 with regard to ABA and abiotic stress responses.	33288024	Our previous study demonstrated that the expression of GhNAC4, a NAC transcription factor from cotton, was induced by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ABA and stress response of GhNAC4. Overexpression of GhNAC4 in transgenic tobacco conferred tolerance to salinity and drought treatments with associated enhanced expression of several stress-responsive marker genes. GhNAC4 is a protein that is translocated to the nucleus where it exhibits transcriptional activation property and also forms homo-dimers. In this study, we also investigated the domains essential for the biochemical functions of GhNAC4. We developed transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the GhNAC4 NAC-domain and the transcriptional regulatory (TR) domain separately. NAC-domain transgenics showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA while TR-domain transgenics exhibited reduced sensitivity. Abiotic stress assays indicated that transgenic plants expressing both the domains separately were more tolerant than wild type plants with the NAC-domain transgenics showing increased tolerance as compared to TR-domain transgenics. Expression analysis revealed that various stress-responsive genes were upregulated in both NAC-domain and TR-domain transgenics under salinity and drought treatments. These results suggest that the stress tolerance ability of GhNAC4 is associated with both the component domains while the ABA responsiveness is largely associated with N-terminal NAC-domain.

Tomato BZR/BES transcription factor SlBZR1 positively regulates BR signaling and salt stress tolerance in tomato and Arabidopsis.	33288025	Brassinosteroids (BRs) play critical roles in plant growth and development, as well as in responses to abiotic stresses. The BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) families of transcription factors have been elucidated largely in Arabidopsis and rice but not in other plant species. Here, we studied the functional characterization of a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) BZR homolog gene, SlBZR1, in BR-regulated plant growth and tolerance to salt stress. SlBZR1 was highly expressed in the flowers and developing fruits of tomato. Both SlBZR1 and SlBZR1D (proline to leucine mutation at the 239th amino acid of SlBZR1) were transcriptional repressors and localized in the nucleus. SlBZR1 or SlBZR1D could interact with SlMYB30, SlMYBL2, SlPIF4, SlHAT1, SlIWS1 and SlREF6 in tomato. Overexpression of SlBZR1D enhanced the BR response and improved tolerance to salt stress in Arabidopsis, consistent with the phenotype of the Arabidopsis bes1-D mutant. Moreover, SlBZR1D-overexpressing tomato lines showed a short plant height, smaller and curly leaves, and delayed flowering. Additionally, SlBZR1D positively regulated salt tolerance in tomato and upregulated the expression of multiple stress-related genes. Our study provides new insights for understanding the function and mechanism of BZR transcription factors in BR-regulated plant growth and abiotic stress responses.	BES1	 1

Transcription factor CsDOF regulates glutamine metabolism in tea plants (Camellia sinensis).	33288026	Glutamine plays a critical role in ammonium assimilation, and contributes substantially to the taste and nutritional quality of tea. To date, little research has been done on glutamine synthesis in tea plants. Here, a zinc finger protein CsDOF and a glutamine synthetase (GS)-encoding gene CsGS2 from tea plant (Camellia sinensis cv 'Shuchazao') were characterized, and their role in glutamine biosynthesis was determined using transient suppression assays in tea leaves and overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression patterns of CsDOF and CsGS2, the GS activity and the glutamine content of photosynthetic tissues (leaf and bud) were significantly induced by shade. Suppressing the expression of CsDOF resulted in downregulated expression of CsGS2 and reduction of the leaf glutamine content. Moreover, in CsDOF-silenced plants, the expression of CsDOF and the glutamine content under shade treatment were higher than in natural light. The glutamine content and CsGS2 transcript level were also decreased in tea leaves when CsGS2 was suppressed, while they were higher under shade treatment than in natural light in CsGS2-silenced plants. In addition, the glutamine content and GS2 transcript level were increased when CsDOF and CsGS2 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. In binding analyses, CsDOF directly bound to an AAAG motif in the promoter of CsGS2, and promotes its activity. The study shed new light on the molecular mechanism by which CsDOF activates CsGS2 gene expression and contributes to glutamine biosynthesis in tea plants.	GS)-encoding	 glutamine synthetase
Approaching the genetic dissection of indirect adventitious organogenesis process in tomato explants.	33288027	The screening of 862 T-DNA lines was carried out to approach the genetic dissection of indirect adventitious organogenesis in tomato. Several mutants defective in different phases of adventitious organogenesis, namely callus growth (tdc-1), bud differentiation (tdb-1, -2, -3) and shoot-bud development (tds-1) were identified and characterized. The alteration of the TDC-1 gene blocked callus proliferation depending on the composition of growth regulators in the culture medium. Calli from tds-1 explants differentiated buds but did not develop normal shoots. Histological analysis showed that their abnormal development is due to failure in the organization of normal adventitious shoot meristems. Interestingly, tdc-1 and tds-1 mutant plants were indistinguishable from WT ones, indicating that the respective altered genes play specific roles in cell proliferation from explant cut zones (TDC-1 gene) or in the organization of adventitious shoot meristems (TDS-1 gene). Unlike the previous, plants of the three mutants defective in the differentiation of adventitious shoot-buds (tdb-1, -2, -3) showed multiple changes in vegetative and reproductive traits. Cosegregation analyses revealed the existence of an association between the phenotype of the tdb-3 mutant and a T-DNA insert, which led to the discovery that the SlMAPKKK17 gene is involved in the shoot-bud differentiation process.

Phosphate deficiency enhances cotton resistance to Verticillium dahliae through activating jasmonic acid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid pathway.	33288028	Living in natural environment, plants often suffer from various biotic and abiotic stresses. Phosphate deficiency is a common factor affecting crop production in field, while pathogen invasion is another serious problem. Here we report that Pi-deficient cotton plants exhibit enhanced resistance to Verticillium dahliae. Transcriptomic and histochemical analysis revealed that cotton phenylpropanoid pathway was activated under phosphate deficiency, including lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis. Metabolomic data showed that Pi-deficient cotton accumulates many flavonoids metabolites and displays obvious anti-fungi activity in terms of methanolic extract. Additionally, JA biosynthesis was activated under phosphate deficiency and the Pi-deficiency induced disease resistance was significantly attenuated in GhAOS knock down plants. Taken together, our study demonstrated that phosphate deficiency enhanced cotton resistance to V. dahliae through activating phenylpropanoid pathway and JA biosynthesis, providing new insights into how phosphate deficiency affects plant disease resistance.

MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	33288029	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.

Characterization of the N- terminal domain of Mre11 protein from rice (OsMre11) Oryza sativa.	33288030	Chromosomal breaks occur in the genome of all living organisms upon exposure to ionizing radiation, xenobiotics and as intermediates during normal cell cycle progression. Most of the information on DNA repair process has emerged from bacteria, human, mice, and yeast while information on plant DNA repair genes and proteins is limited. Among other DNA repair proteins, MRE11 forms the core of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex and is the first responder to double strand breaks (DSBs), promotes repair either by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homologous Recombination (HR). Till date, MRE11 has not been biochemically characterized from plant systems. Here, we report the in vitro biochemical activities of Oryza sativa MRE11. We cloned and purified the N- terminal region of OsMre11, which represents both the nuclease and DNA binding domains. The N- terminal end of OsMre11-N protein (∼55.0 kDa) showed binding activity with dsDNA, ssDNA and G-quadruplex DNA. Tryptophan fluorescence analysis also showed that OsMre11-N protein binds to ssDNA, dsDNA and G4 DNA in a protein concentration dependant manner. Additionally, OsMre11 protein showed exonuclease activity only in the presence of Mn2+. A protein concentration dependant endonuclease activity also was observed and was enhanced in the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. Put together, OsMre11 has properties similar to its counterparts in yeast and humans and may play an important role in cellular response to DNA damage in plants, especially rice.	HR	ous

Hydrogen sulfide: Roles in plant abiotic stress response and crosstalk with other signals.	33288031	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recently recognized as an endogenous gas transmitter alongside nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Exposure of plants to H2S, for example through applicating H2S donors, reveals that H2S play important roles in plant response to abiotic stresses such as heavy metals, salinity, drought and extreme temperatures. Sodium hydrosulfide is the most widely used donor in plants due to its direct and instantaneous release of H2S, followed by GYY4137. H2S can enhance plant tolerance to salt and heavy metal stresses through regulating Na+/K+ homeostasis and the uptake and transport of metal ions. H2S also promotes the H2S-Cys cycle balance under abiotic stress and enhances its roles in regulation of the antioxidant system, alternative respiratory pathway, and heavy metal chelators synthesis. H2S coordinates with gaseous signal molecules, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide to respond to stress directly through influencing their generation or competing for the regulation of the downstream signaling. Moreover, H2S interacts with phytohormones including abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid and melatonin as well as polyamines to regulate plant response to abiotic stresses. In this review, the application of H2S donors and their functional mechanism are summarized. We propose promising new research directions, which can lead to new insights on the role of this gastrasmitter during plant growth and development.	H2S	 Hydrogen sulfide
Overexpression of ThMYB8 mediates salt stress tolerance by directly activating stress-responsive gene expression.	33288032	MYB transcription factors are important in abiotic stress responses; however, the detailed mechanisms are unclear. Tamarix hispida contains multiple MYB genes. The present study characterized T. hispida MYB8 (ThMYB8) during salt stress using transgenic T. hispida and Arabidopsis assays. ThMYB8 overexpression and ThMYB8 RNAi analysis demonstrated that ThMYB8 enhanced the salt stress tolerance. Transgenic Arabidopsis ectopic expression of ThMYB8 significantly increased root growth, fresh weight, and seed germination rate compared with that of the wild-type under salt stress. Physiological parameters analysis in T. hispida and Arabidopsis showed that ThMYB8 overexpressing plants had the lowest levels of O2, H2O2, cell death, malondialdehyde, and electrolyte leakage. Overexpression of ThMYB8 regulated Na+ and K+ concentrations in plant tissues while maintaining K+/Na+ homeostasis. Analysis using qRT-PCR and ChIP-PCR identified possible downstream ThMYB8-regulated genes. ThMYB8 regulated the expression of ThCYP450-2 (cytochrome p450-2), Thltk (leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinase), and ThTIP (aquaporin TIP) by binding to the MBSI motif ('CAACTG') in their promoters. The results indicated that ThMYB8 enhanced salt stress tolerance in T. hispida by regulating gene expression related to the activation of stress-associated physiological changes, such as enhanced reactive oxygen species scavenging capability, maintaining K+/Na+ homeostasis, and decreasing the malondialdehyde content and lipid peroxidation cell membranes.

It predominantly affects women. Demodicosis is an inflammatory disease associated with cutaneous overpopulation of the mite Demodex spp., the pathogenesis of which is not completely established, but is frequently related to local immunodeficiency. A case of a young woman with amicrobial pustulosis of the folds, and isolated worsening of facial lesions, is reported; investigation revealed overlapping demodicosis. There was complete regression of lesions with acaricide and cyclin treatment. This case warns of a poorly diagnosed but disfiguring and stigmatizing disease, often associated with underlying dermatoses or inadvertent treatments on the face.	odexĠspp.,	 mite Dem

Genital angiokeratoma in a woman with Fabry disease: the dermatologist's role.	33288094	Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, inherited in an X-linked manner. It is characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, leading to a buildup of glycosphingolipids in the cells. Angiokeratoma is one of the cutaneous manifestations of this condition, and it helps making the diagnosis. The typical site involves the genital area in men and lumbosacral, buttocks and trunk region in both sexes. We report a case of genital angiokeratoma in a woman with Fabry disease. The diagnosis is through molecular analysis and, when made early, starting treatment reduces the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Thus, the dermatologist has an important role in the identification of angiokeratoma as a cutaneous marker, and the knowledge of its different presentations is essential for the early diagnosis and management of Fabry disease.

Erythrodermic psoriasis and human immunodeficiency virus: association and therapeutic challenges.	33288098	Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare but severe type of psoriasis that may be triggered by human immunodeficiency virus infection. We describe the case of a 65-year-old male patient with chronic psoriasis who presents an exacerbation of his condition over a period of two weeks. Because of the severity of his case and subsequent need for systemic therapy, human immunodeficiency virus enzyme immunoassay was performed and tested positive. He thus began antiretroviral therapy combined with acitretin, showing good clinical response after 8 weeks of treatment. There is little evidence regarding the management of erythrodermic psoriasis associated with HIV infection, so antiretroviral therapy and systemic retinoid remain as the first-line treatment.

New insights into the pathophysiology and risk factors for PONV.	33288117	Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	GI	 gastrointestinal

Clinical and economic burden of postoperative nausea and vomiting: Analysis of existing cost data.	33288118	Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is an undesirable outcome that occurs in up to 30% of patients. Over the years, the cost of treating PONV has decreased due to the availability of cheaper yet effective antiemetics. Limiting PONV development benefits the hospital system as studies have shown that prevention is associated with shorter post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stays as well as decreased supply costs and staffing burden. The financial burden for prophylaxis against PONV has been shown to be less than what patients are willing to pay to prevent the development of PONV. Studies have also shown that prevention of initial development of PONV limits readmission rates, which is beneficial to both the patient and the hospital. Owing to recent economic analysis and reductions in antiemetic prices, the patient's preference for comfort, the hospital's commitment to providing the best care, and the system's desire for fiscal prudence are aligned. This culminates in recommending PONV prophylaxis for all patients undergoing anesthesia.	PACU	 post-anesthesia care unit

What is the ideal combination antiemetic regimen?	33288120	Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and post-discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) are frequent unpleasant complaints that patients and clinicians report after surgery. PONV and PDNV have been associated with postoperative complications and hospital discharge delays. Despite the extensive evidence describing the use of several regimens in different surgical populations, the ideal regimen has not been established. Several antiemetic drugs have been evaluated in more than 1000 clinical controlled trials for management of this complex emetogenic pathway, including the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists, neurokinin-type receptor antagonists, antihistaminics, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids, with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists being the most commonly used for PONV prophylaxis. Because of the complex emetogenic pathway and multifactorial etiology of PONV, a multimodal approach using two or more drugs that act at different neuro-receptor sites is suggested in patients with one or more risk factors to successfully address PONV and reduce its incidence. Nevertheless, the most studied regimens in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the combination of serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with dexamethasone or dopamine receptor antagonists (droperidol). Therefore, the safest and more effective combination regimen appears to be the use of serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetic drugs with dexamethasone.	Ġ5-HT3	 serotonin

Because of the complex emetogenic pathway and multifactorial etiology of PONV, a multimodal approach using two or more drugs that act at different neuro-receptor sites is suggested in patients with one or more risk factors to successfully address PONV and reduce its incidence. Nevertheless, the most studied regimens in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the combination of serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with dexamethasone or dopamine receptor antagonists (droperidol). Therefore, the safest and more effective combination regimen appears to be the use of serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetic drugs with dexamethasone.	Ġ5-HT3	 serotonin

Is there a place for genetics in the management of PONV?	33288121	Antiemetic prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) - a frequent complication in the postoperative period - is routinely given to high-risk patients. However, standard PONV risk models do not account for genetic factors, which have been shown to have a significant influence on PONV incidence and drug response. In this review, we describe the polymorphisms of various genes (serotonin, dopamine, cholinergic, etc.) and how pharmacogenomics is involved in the pathophysiology of PONV. This review also addresses how genetics is involved in today's clinical practice related to PONV and how it will change in the upcoming years as personalized medicine advances.

Risk-adapted strategy or universal multimodal approach for PONV prophylaxis?	33288122	"The issue of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains important in surgical practice, contributing to patient distress, slower recovery, and increased use of healthcare resources. Many surgical patients report it to be a worse problem than pain. Numerous findings of research indicate that PONV significantly affects patients' well-being and is among the important determinants of patient satisfaction with perioperative care. Numerous investigations have confirmed the efficacy of combining pharmacological interventions indicating that PONV is a clinical complication that is in principle avoidable. Nonetheless, PONV continues to be bothersome for too many patients. Thus, perhaps the biggest challenge across the field is to achieve a uniformly high standard of PONV management using the currently available resources. Although a risk-adapted approach has been advocated in the past, the current trend incorporated in clinical guidelines support a more liberal approach of multimodal antiemetic prevention. The current article emphasizes pros and cons of the various approaches to PONV prophylaxis and depicts most promising strategies to achieve a ""PONV-free hospital."""

The optimum management of nausea and vomiting during and after cesarean delivery.	33288123	Intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) afflict up to 80% of parturients undergoing cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia. Preventing nausea and emesis is a top priority for women undergoing cesarean delivery and is included in the quality of recovery measures and enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery protocols. The majority of known perioperative emetic triggers can be avoided or mitigated by optimizing anesthetic and surgical management. IONV may arise from spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension, intraoperative pain, and medications such as uterotonics and antibiotics. Furthermore, uterine exteriorization and peritoneal irrigation increase IONV risk. Conversely, preventing PONV mainly focuses on optimizing analgesia through an opioid-sparing, multimodal strategy. In addition, combination prophylactic antiemetic therapy should be instituted in this high-risk population to further reduce the risk of IONV and PONV.	IONV	 postoperative nausea and vomiting
An update on the management of PONV in a pediatric patient.	33288124	Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major cause of patient dissatisfaction following anesthesia. The difficulty in diagnosing nausea in much of the pediatric population has led to an emphasis on anti-emetic prophylaxis for all. Assessment scores and prognostic tools enable the anesthesiologist to identify patients who are at a greater risk and appropriately apply more aggressive prophylactic, multi-drug strategies. New antiemetics emerging from other medical disciplines, particularly oncology, may have potential use in prophylaxis and treatment of nausea and vomiting in the pediatric surgical population. New agents, many of which have a long duration of action, will augment the anesthesiologist's ability to adequately prevent PONV, and to treat persistent nausea and vomiting that extend beyond the immediate post-operative period.

The next generation of antiemetics for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting.	33288125	Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) afflict approximately 30% of patients overall and up to 80% of high-risk patients after surgery. Optimal pharmacological prophylaxis of PONV is challenging as it necessitates the consideration of PONV risk, drug efficacy, and potential adverse effects. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and risk factors of PONV, its incidence has remained largely unchanged. Newer antiemetics have been introduced that may have improved safety profiles, longer duration of action, and better efficacy. This review aims to summarize the recent developments pertaining to these new agents and their potential application toward the management of PONV.	PONV	 Postoperative nausea and vomiting
Management of postdischarge nausea and vomiting.	33288126	Postdischarge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) occurs in at least 30% of patients leaving hospital, especially after day-case surgery. A significant number of ambulatory patients may develop PDNV associated with the use of analgesics for postsurgical pain. A validated PDNV prediction score and international evidence-based consensus guidelines for PONV/PDNV management are available. High-risk patients benefit from a predischarge PDNV risk assessment and the use of adapted pharmacological intervention (combination of long- and short-acting antiemetics and access to antiemetics at home). Patient education is often overlooked in this context. All clinicians involved in the ambulatory surgery care process should participate in the development of institutional protocol for PONV/PDNV management. Constant quality control and patients' feedback should be integrated as part of an efficient implementation strategy.	PDNV	 Postdischarge nausea and vomiting

Treating pediatric colorectal patients in low and middle income settings: Creative adaptation to the resources available.	33288130	"Colorectal disease profiles for children in low- and middle-income settings (LMIC) are characterized by late presentation, increased complications and limited follow-up in many cases. There is a high prevalence of infectious conditions causing secondary colorectal disease such as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis(TB), Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) and Human Papilloma Virus(HPV), which also impact the management of other primary colorectal conditions, such as wound-healing and intestinal anastomosis. Perineal trauma from sexual assault, motor vehicle or pedestrian accidents, burns, and traditional enemas are commonly encountered and may require adaptation of principles used in treatment of congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung's disease and Anorectal Malformations for reconstruction. Endemic conditions in certain LMIC require further research to delineate underlying causes and optimize management, such as ""African"" degenerative visceral leiomyopathy, congenital pouch colon in the Indian subcontinent, and congenital H-type rectal fistulae prevalent in Asia. These unique disease profiles require creative adaptations of resources within poor healthcare infrastructure settings. These special challenges and pitfalls in colorectal care and complications of adverse socioeconomic conditions, are discussed."	ĠLMIC	 Human Papilloma Virus(HPV
Radiology of anorectal malformations: What does the surgeon need to know?	33288131	Imaging is extremely important throughout all phases of care provided to children with anorectal malformations (ARM). A preoperative determination of the patient specific malformation will help establish the operative plan. Moreover, the majority of ARM patients will have an associated anomaly that will require imaging workup for full understanding of those abnormalities prior to addressing the ARM. The complexity of ARM care will mandate continued imaging throughout the post-operative period even in those with straight forward malformations.	ARM	 anorectal malformations
Lasting impact on children with an anorectal malformations with proper surgical preparation, respect for anatomic principles, and precise surgical management.	33288132	Optimal outcomes in the management of children with Anorectal Malformation (ARM) require careful surgical preparation and detailed understanding of the anatomic principles and operative setup. A clear understanding of operative anatomy and surgical principals guides decision making. Adherence to the principles of ARM repair, as well as the application of operative and imaging adjuncts, will yield the safest and most successful approach to ARM. In this review, we detail the surgical preparation, anatomic principles, and surgical management issues unique to ARM.	ARM	 Anorectal Malformation
Adjuncts to bowel management for fecal incontinence and constipation, the role of surgery; appendicostomy, cecostomy, neoappendicostomy, and colonic resection.	33288138	Constipation and fecal incontinence are common problems in children after repair of an anorectal malformation (ARM). While many children can be effectively managed with an oral laxative regimen, others require a mechanical colonic washout to achieve social continence. Appendicostomy and cecostomy are two techniques which permit antegrade access to the colon for the purpose of enema delivery, which improves compliance and quality of life for patients and families. The purpose of this article is to review, using a case-based approach, the indications for placement of a channel for antegrade enema access, clinical scenarios in which one technique would be preferred over another, common complications following each procedure.

Importance of education and the role of the patient and family in the care of anorectal malformations.	33288139	"During this early part of the 21st century online technology has prompted many major advances in medical care. In this section we argue that this is particularly evident in the treatment and care of patients born with Anorectal Malformation (ARM) and Hirschsprung's Disease (HD). Our stories show that anyone born with these complex colorectal conditions in the 20th century was destined to a life of isolation and stigma. Here we explore the lack of understanding and recognition of the psychological effects on children and families which has characterised this period. We show that advances in clinical practice has been supported by developing social media platforms. There has been a rapid creation of online support groups for patients and families which has enabled survivors' greater access to patient and parent organizations across the globe and thereby stimulated a sense of belonging and solidarity. Online technology and social media platforms have also opened up the opportunity for pediatric medical professionals to provide a greater level of patient education. There is no doubt families have become much more aware of the complexities of ARM & HD and achieved greater comfort and understanding of their needs. We have generated ""lightbulb moments"" for pediatric providers with adult ARM & HD patients, enabling them to share their lived experiences in a therapeutic exchange. In the past survivors felt they were abandoned by the adult healthcare system. We are seeing evidence-based research of major psychosocial issues experienced by adult patients and, as a result, improved understanding of how to treat ARM & HD survivors across their whole of life journey. The winds of change continue to direct our cohorts to a mature approach based on improving levels of interactive communication and education. We argue that this maturity has mostly been facilitated by the use of online technology and the ensuing collaboration between providers and patient and parent organizations."

Intrasarcoplasmic Polyglucosan Inclusions in Heart and Skeletal Muscles of Long-Finned Pilot Whales (Globicephala melas) may be Age-Related.	33288146	Polysaccharide storage myopathies have been described in several animal species and are characterized by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, diastase-resistant intrasarcoplasmic inclusions in myocytes. Skeletal and cardiac muscle samples from a subset of a single pod of stranded long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) were evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopy. Twelve individuals demonstrated sporadic basophilic packets of PAS-positive, diastase-resistant complex polysaccharide material, either centrally or peripherally, in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Few microscopic myopathic changes were found but included focal inflammation and internalized nuclei. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions consisted of loosely arranged, tangled filaments and were not membrane-bound, which is consistent with polyglucosan inclusions. Within skeletal muscle, the number of inclusions had a marginal statistically significant (P = 0.0536) correlation with length, as a proxy for age, suggesting that such inclusions in skeletal muscles may be age-related, although the cause remains unclear.

Cetacean Morbillivirus Infection in a Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) from Brazil.	33288147	We provide pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular evidence of cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) infection in a live-stranded adult female killer whale (Orcinus orca), which stranded alive in Espírito Santo State, Brazil, in 2014. Although attempts were made to release the animal, it stranded again and died. The main pathological findings were severe pulmonary oedema, pleural petechiation, multifocal, lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis and leptomeningomyelitis with perivascular cuffing and gliosis, chronic lymphocytic bronchointerstitial pneumonia and multicentric lymph node and splenic lymphoid depletion. Other pathological findings were associated with the 'live-stranding stress response'. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed multifocal morbilliviral antigen in neurons and astrocytes, and in pneumocytes, histiocytes and leukocytes in the lung. CeMV was detected by a novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method in the brain and kidney. Phylogenetic analysis of part of the morbillivirus phosphoprotein gene indicates that the virus is similar to the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) morbillivirus strain, known to affect cetaceans along the coast of Brazil. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of morbillivirus disease in killer whales.	CeMV	 cetacean morbillivirus
Porcine Astrovirus Type 5-Associated Enteritis in Pigs.	33288149	Astroviruses (AstVs) are emerging, potentially zoonotic pathogens, associated with enteric and neurological signs in various animal species. In pigs, five lineages have been identified, porcine AstVs (PoAstVs) 1-5. We now report PoAstV5-associated atrophic enteritis in a colostrum-deprived (CD) pig and a similar disease in field cases of enteritis. Four newborn CD piglets were housed under biosafety level 2 conditions and monitored for the presence of PoAstV RNA in rectal swabs and tissues. PoAstV4 RNA was detected in low numbers (0.9-5.3 log10 genomic copies/rectal swab) in rectal swabs from all of these pigs while all animals were negative for PoAstV1, PoAstV2, PoAstV3 and PoAstV5. At 19 and 20 days of age, high levels of PoAstV5 RNA (7.4-7.5 log10 genomic copies/rectal swab) were detected in one pig, which had developed enteritis. At necropsy 1 day after the first evidence of PoAstV5 shedding, this pig was strongly positive for PoAstV5 RNA in most tissues with strong immunolabelling of PoAstV5 in enterocytes. Gene sequencing confirmed PoAstV5 infection. A retrospective investigation of PoAstVs 3, 4 and 5 in archival tissues from field cases of post-weaning enteritis identified high PoAstV4 or PoAstV5 antigen levels in intestinal tissues. These pigs were often concurrently infected with porcine rotavirus. Our findings suggest that PoAstV5 may contribute to the pathogenesis of enteritis in young pigs.	CD	 colostrum-deprived

Brunner's Gland Adenocarcinoma in an Aged Western Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla).	33288150	A 50-year-old male western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) presented with severe bradypragia, anorexia and vomiting. Despite continuous administration of antiphlogistic analgesic drugs and supportive care, the animal died and was submitted for post-mortem examination. Macroscopically, a large mass was located in the duodenum. The mucosal surface of the duodenum was irregular and thickened, and the lumen narrowed. The duodenal lesion was identified as a tubular adenocarcinoma and the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 19 and mucin-6 protein. Ultrastructurally, the apical cytoplasm of neoplastic cells had electron dense granules and apical microvilli. This is the first reported case of Brunner's gland adenocarcinoma in a gorilla.

p53 Gene Mutation in Blood of Zebu Cattle with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Horn.	33288151	Horn cancer is one of the most important diseases in Zebu castrated male cattle. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of p53 gene mutation in the blood of affected cattle and its value for early diagnosis and prognosis. The study was conducted on blood samples from 20 affected cattle and six healthy control cattle from Western India. Plasma samples were evaluated for the presence of p53 gene mutation using the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique and the results were correlated with the stage of cancer. Five of the 20 cases had stage I neoplasms, nine stage II and six stage III, based on histopathological examination. PCR-SSCP analysis revealed an aberrant pattern of DNA migration on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DNA extracts from blood samples of six animals with stage II and stage III cancer. No mutation was identified in blood from cattle with stage I cancer or from healthy control cattle. These results suggest that PCR-SSCP detection of p53 gene mutation in blood has potential diagnostic and prognostic value, and indicate the need for further large-scale investigation.

Do Canine Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Resemble Human Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours? A Comparative Morphological and Immunohistochemical Investigation.	33288156	Although canine pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) have been proposed as a model for the counterpart human neoplasms, the type or grade of human PanNEN that they resemble is unclear. PanNENs in animals are classified as adenoma or carcinoma, whereas in humans they are classified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET) if well-differentiated, or as pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PanNEC) if poorly differentiated. We evaluated 16 canine primary PanNENs and two metastases histologically and immunohistochemically, and graded them using the animal and human grading systems. All neoplasms had local or vascular invasion and were classified as pancreatic islet cell carcinomas according to the current WHO classification. The Ki-67 index was low in all cases (0.01-1.50%). All had cytoplasmic expression of synaptophysin and insulin but were immunonegative for glucagon, confirming a functional diagnosis of canine insulinoma. Membranous expression of SSTR2A and nuclear expression of ATRX, but no p53 expression, was found in all neoplasms. One primary tumour was diagnosed as a mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm, which is the first report of this neoplasm in dogs. The other 15 primary tumours and both metastatic tumours were graded as PanNET G1, according to the human WHO classification. We conclude that canine PanNENs share well-differentiated histomorphology, SSTR2A expression and absence of nuclear p53 immunolabelling with human PanNETs G1. However, they differ in ATRX gene expression and functionality, and seem to have a worse prognosis than human PanNETs G1, although their generally low Ki-67 index precludes more precise assessment of prognosis. Membranous SSTR2A expression renders canine PanNENs potentially amenable to treatment with somatostatin analogues or SSTR targeted in-vivo imaging methods.	PanNEC	 pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma

The other 15 primary tumours and both metastatic tumours were graded as PanNET G1, according to the human WHO classification. We conclude that canine PanNENs share well-differentiated histomorphology, SSTR2A expression and absence of nuclear p53 immunolabelling with human PanNETs G1. However, they differ in ATRX gene expression and functionality, and seem to have a worse prognosis than human PanNETs G1, although their generally low Ki-67 index precludes more precise assessment of prognosis. Membranous SSTR2A expression renders canine PanNENs potentially amenable to treatment with somatostatin analogues or SSTR targeted in-vivo imaging methods.

The Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Cell Survival and Death.	33288157	It is now increasingly recognized that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is caused by the accumulation of overproduced or misfolded proteins in this organelle, contributes to the pathogenesis of a diverse range of human diseases. ER stress initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt to restore cellular protein homeostasis and promote cell survival. However, when ER stress is severe or protracted, and uncompensated, the UPR can fail, resulting in cell death, often by apoptosis. ER stress has received relatively little attention in the veterinary literature and the intent of this mini review is to describe the essential features of ER stress and UPR in determining the survival or demise of an affected cell and encourage further study of its role in the pathogenesis of diseases of domestic animal species. The role of ER stress, particularly when chronic and unrelieved, in the pathogenesis of a number of specific diseases is also discussed.	UPR	 unfolded protein response

Outbreak of Paranannizziopsis australasiensis Infection in Captive African Bush Vipers (Atheris squamigera).	33288159	We report the epidemiological, clinical and pathological features of an outbreak of Paranannizziopsis australasiensis (order Onygenales) in captive African bush vipers (Atheris squamigera) (ABVs) that died suddenly. The snakes had multifocal, raised, white-grey to dark brown discoloured cutaneous patches. Microscopically, all had integumentary lesions characterized by multifocal to coalescent necroheterophilic epidermitis with superficial and intraepidermal fungal elements and bacteria. Concurrent epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and intracellular and intercellular oedema, often leading to vesiculation, and fasciitis/superficial myositis, were consistent findings in all snakes, while ulceration (9/11) and dysecdysis (5/11) varied. A panfungal polymerase chain reaction targeting the internal transcribed spacer-2 region, and gene sequencing, confirmed P. australasiensis infection in three cases. This is the first report of P. australasiensis in the USA and the first record of paranannizziopsis infection in African bush vipers. P. australasiensis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dermatomycosis in snakes and represents a potential threat to reptile conservation programmes.	ABVs	 African bush vipers
Effects of thermal processing on the flavor molecules of goat by-product hydrolysates.	33288160	The aim of this study was to obtain flavor molecules from goat by-product hydrolysates, emphasizing the thermal action during processing. A mixture of by-products submitted or not to the inactivation of endogenous enzymes was used, followed by hydrolysis with the proteolytic enzyme Alcalase® (Bacillus licheniformis), and autoclaving after hydrolysis. The production of hydrolysates provided both quantitative and qualitative data on the precursors involved in the aromatic formation of protein hydrolysates. The inactivation process of endogenous enzymes resulted in hydrolysates with a higher degree of hydrolysis and greater protein content. The autoclaving process produced a significant increase in the concentration of free amino acids and maltose and a reduction in the glucose content. Application of the two heat treatments resulted in the production of goat by-product protein hydrolysates with different volatile profiles. The goat by-product protein hydrolysate without heat treatment but with autoclaving (HCA), showing a higher concentration of flavor precursors and the formation of heterocyclic volatiles, is expected to impact the aroma quality of goat hydrolysates.

Functional microbiota in Chinese traditional Baijiu and Mijiu Qu (starters): A review.	33288161	Chinese traditional fermented foods have a very long and complex history. These fermented foods have fascinating characteristics. These are mainly produced by autochthonous fermentation, involving an autochthonous complex microbiota in these fermented products which confers amazing functional characteristics. These include desirable taste, aroma, texture, exopolysaccharides, α-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, xylanase, antioxidants, and aglycone isoflavones which are produced along with other substances. Baijiu is a traditional Chinese spirit, which is widely consumed in East Asia, especially China, and is considered one of the most consumed spirits in the world. It is produced by autochthonously prepared traditional qu (starter culture), such as Xiaoqu, Daqu, Fuqu, and others. Microbial communities in various qu, thereof, have still not been properly characterized. There are several factors that contribute to microbial communities and to the final products of fermentation. This review shall succinctly describe recent scientific research on the production of flavor compounds by bacteria and fungi in Chinese traditional Baijiu qu (starter cultures), with special focus on the fungi and bacteria, and their functionalities with respect to flavor development in Baijiu.

Physicochemical properties and gelling behaviour of Bambara groundnut protein isolates and protein-enriched fractions.	33288162	Plant proteins, and specifically those from legume crops, are increasingly recognised as sustainable and functional food ingredients. In this study, we expand on the knowledge of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) [BGN] proteins, by characterising the composition, microstructure and rheological properties of BGN protein isolates obtained via wet extraction and protein-enriched fractions obtained via dry fractionation. The BGN protein isolates were compared in the context of the major storage protein, vicilin, as previously identified. Molecular weight analysis performed with gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography coupled to light-scattering, revealed some major bands (190 kDa) and elution patterns with molecular weights (205.6-274.1 kDa) corresponding to that of BGN vicilin, whilst the thermal denaturation temperature (Tp 91.1 °C, pH 7) of BGN protein isolates also coincided to that of the vicilin fraction. Furthermore, the concentration dependence of the elastic modulus G' of the BGN protein isolates, closely resembled that of BGN vicilin (both upon NaCl addition); suggesting that vicilin is the main component responsible for gelation. Confocal laser scanning and scanning electron micrographs revealed inhomogeneous aggregate structures, which implies that fractal scaling were better suited for description of the BGN protein isolate gel networks. Concerning the BGN protein-enriched fractions, both rotor and impact milling with air jet sieving and air classification, respectively, were successfully applied to separate these fractions from those high in starch; as evident from compositional analysis, particle size distributions and microscopic imaging. When considering sustainability aspects, dry fractionation could thus be a viable alternative for producing BGN protein-enriched fractions.	Tp	 thermal denaturation temperature

Polysaccharides from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. Ameliorate ulcerative colitis via extensive modification of gut microbiota and host metabolism.	33288163	Turbulence of gut microbiota metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids is an important factor in the development of diseases. Many polysaccharides are effective on diseases including ulcerative colitis (UC), yet most studies investigating the mechanisms of polysaccharides mainly focused on their effects on gut microbiota composition and SCFAs, and other metabolites of gut microbiota are often neglected. Here, we examined the effects of polysaccharides from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (AMP) on experimental UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and explored underlying mechanisms of AMP by 16S rDNA-based gut microbiota analysis and untargeted fecal and plasma metabolomics. In addition, a multiscale, multifactorial network was constructed to visualize the mechanisms of AMP. The results showed that AMP significantly increased body weight and ameliorated colonic injury in DSS treated mice. AMP also partly restored the perturbed gut microbiota composition induced by DSS. Untargeted fecal and plasma metabolomics showed that AMP can not only modulate the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, but also the ability to digest food nutrients, metabolism of amino acids and bile acids, production of cadaverine and other metabolites by hosts and gut microbiota. The study demonstrated that, in addition to SCFAs, AMP can extensively modulate the metabolism of gut microbiota and hosts to achieve the therapeutic effects. This study adds new mechanisms of polysaccharides in treating diseases.	DSS	 dextran sulfate sodium

Lycium barbarum polysaccharide attenuates myocardial injury in high-fat diet-fed mice through manipulating the gut microbiome and fecal metabolome.	33288164	High-fat diets (HFDs) can induce health problems including gut microbiota dysbiosis and cardiac dysfunction. In this study, we modulated the gut microbiota in mice to investigate whether Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP), a potential prebiotic fiber, could alleviate HFD-induced myocardial injury. Mice fed a HFD were given LBP (HFPD group) by gavage once/day for 2 months. Left ventricular function and serum trimethylamine N-oxide were significantly improved in HFPD mice compared with HFD mice. HFD increased the abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Romboutsia, while LBP increased the abundances of Gordonibacter, Parabacteroides, and Anaerostipes. Fecal metabolic profiling revealed significant increases in metabolites involved in nicotinate, nicotinamide and purine metabolism pathways, as well as indole derivatives of tryptophan metabolites in the HFPD group. LBP reduced intestinal permeability and inflammatory cytokine levels, maintained a healthy intestinal microenvironment, and alleviated myocardial injury. Modulating the gut microbiota is a potential treatment for cardiovascular diseases.	LBP	 Lycium barbarum polysaccharide

Evaluating the effect of using non-Saccharomyces on Oenococcus oeni and wine malolactic fermentation.	33288165	Interest in using non-Saccharomyces yeasts in winemaking has increased in recent years due to their ability to improve wine quality. However, little information has been published regarding the possible effect on malolactic fermentation (MLF), carried out mostly by Oenococcus oeni. The aim of this paper is therefore to evaluate the effect of the most representative non-Saccharomyces species on O. oeni and wine MLF. Different strains of Torulaspora delbrueckii, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora vineae and Starmerella bacillaris (syn. Candida zemplinina) were used in sequential alcoholic fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting wines were inoculated with four O. oeni strains. The action of non-Saccharomyces affected the final wine composition and the later role of O. oeni. Some of its strains could not perform MLF in H. uvarum wine due to high SO2 concentrations. In some cases, MLF was inhibited in wines inoculated with S. bacillaris. All the H. uvarum and H. vineae strains notably increased acetic acid concentrations, thus threatening wine quality. The best conditions for MLF were provided by some T. delbruecckii and M. pulcherrima strains, which showed increased concentrations of mannoproteins - compounds described as MLF activators -, no production of SO2, and low consumption of L-malic acid. In conclusion, non-Saccharomyces yeasts have diverse effects on O. oeni and MLF depending on the species, with T. delbrueckii and M. pulcherrima being those that showed the best compatibility with MLF development.

Food and food products associated with food allergy and food intolerance - An overview.	33288166	Immune-mediated food allergy and non-immune mediated food intolerance are categorized as the most common adverse reactions resulting from the ingestion of certain foods. As there is no standard treatment, the possible remedy to avoid exposure to these adverse reactions is adhering to a strict diet that eliminates allergic and intolerant foods. The commonly consumed foods including dairy products, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanut, soybean, and wheat-based products are proven to cause food allergy. Foods containing lactose, gluten, high FODMAPs, biogenic amines, and certain food additives leads to potential health risks in intolerant individuals. Besides, there are various foods whose mechanism of action in triggering food allergy and intolerance is yet to be defined. However, the public in-depth understanding of natural foods, processed foods, and packaged food products that induce allergic reactions and intolerance remains low. Therefore, awareness of diet that partially or completely excludes the intake of certain foods associated with these reactions should be widespread among the consumers.	ĠFODMAPs	 food allergy
Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between caseins and lutein.	33288167	Understanding the food protein binding to bioactive compounds is of utmost importance for the development of efficient protein-based delivery systems. The binding of lutein to sodium caseinate (NaCas) or native casein micelle (PPCN) was investigated at pH 7 to evaluate the effect of casein supramolecular structures on the interaction. Fluorescence quenching, UV-vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering were carried out. Under the medium conditions of interaction analysis (DMSO-water and ethanol-water), lutein exists as H-type aggregates. The investigation of lutein/casein interaction showed a predominantly static mechanism of fluorescence quenching and the presence of two fluorophore populations on NaCas and PPCN, but only one accessible to lutein. Moreover, the Scatchard plot indicated that lutein interacted with both caseins in one binding site. The interaction of lutein with caseins occurred with binding constant Kb of 105 M-1, regardless of casein supramolecular structure.	NaCas	 sodium caseinate
Egg white gel structure determines biochemical digestion with consequences on softening and mechanical disintegration during in vitro gastric digestion.	33288168	The aim of this work was to investigate the role of biochemical digestion on softening and disintegration kinetics of pH 5 and pH 9 egg white gel (EWGs) during in vitro gastric digestion. EWG samples (5 mm length cubes) underwent in vitro digestion by incubation in simulated gastric fluid at different time intervals for up to 240 min. The hardness was measured using a Texture Analyser; softening kinetics was fit to the Weibull model. Results revealed that pH 9 EWG had the highest softening halftime (458 ± 86 min), indicating the slowest softening, whereas pH 5 EWG had the lowest softening halftime (197 ± 12 min), indicating the quickest softening. The digested samples were immediately exposed to mechanical forces generated by the human gastric simulator (HGS) for 10 min to investigate the influence of gastric juice on the breakdown behaviour of EWG cubes. The breakdown behaviour of the disintegrated samples was characterized by fitting the cumulative distributions of particle surface areas to a mixed Weibull function (R2 > 0.99). The weight of fine particles (α) showed that regardless of gastric juice diffusion, the pH 5 EWG (α = 0.22 ± 0.03) disintegrated into more fine particles than those resulting from pH 9 EWG disintegration (α = 0.07 ± 0.02). As expected, the diffusion of gastric juice enhanced erosion of the EWG particles into fine particles. Result obtained from the particle surface area distribution is in good agreement with the softening kinetics of EWGs during simulated in vitro gastric phase.	EWGs	 egg white gel
Effects of drying techniques on the physicochemical, functional, thermal, structural and rheological properties of mung bean (Vigna radiata) protein isolate powder.	33288169	Mung bean is an inexpensive yet sustainable protein source. Current work compared the effects of freeze (FD), spray (SD) and oven drying (OD), on mung bean protein isolate (MBPI) produced on pilot scale. All samples showed no dissociation of protein subunits and were thermally stable (Td = 157.90-158.07 °C). According to morphological studies, FD formed a porous protein while SD and OD formed wrinkled and compact crystals, respectively. FD and SD formed elastic gels with better gelling capacity than OD (aggregated gel). FD showed exceptional protein solubility, water and oil absorption capacity (4.23 g/g and 8.38 g/g, respectively). SD demonstrated the smallest particle size, excellent emulsion activity index (29.21 m2/g) and stability (351.90 min) and the highest β-sheet amount (37.61%). FTIR spectra for all samples showed characteristic peaks which corresponded well to the secondary structure of legume proteins. Rheological analysis revealed that gelation temperature for all MBPI lied around 90 °C. Current work described the different final properties achieved for MBPI produced under different drying techniques that allowed tailoring for different food systems, whereby FD is ideal for meat extender, SD is suitable for meat emulsion while OD is suitable in general protein-based application.

Autogenic successions of bacteria and fungi in kefir grains from different origins when sub-cultured in goat milk.	33288170	Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microbiota, including a variety of bacterial and fungal species. The microbiota in kefir grains is strongly influenced by the geographical origin and sub-culturing environment. After sub-culturing in goat milk for 2 to 4 months, amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS1 region) was applied for the identification of bacterial and fungal autogenic succession of three kefir grains collected from China (CN, Asia), Germany (DE, Europe) and United States of America (USA, America). Taxonomic analysis displayed three main bacterial and fungal species in kefir grains from different origins during sub-culturing process (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus kefiri for bacteria, Kazachstania unispora, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fungi). Based on the results of beta diversity analysis, microbiota in kefir grains from CN and DE would be stable when sub-cultured in goat milk for more than three months. Differently, a highly microbial stability has been found for the sample from USA during the whole sub-culturing process.

Isolation and characterization of indigenous Weissella confusa for in situ bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) production in chickpea sourdough.	33288171	Legume-based sourdough represents a potential ingredient for the manufacture of novel baked products. However, the lack of gluten of legume flours can restrict their use due to their poor technological properties. To overcome such issue, the in situ production of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) during fermentation has been proposed. In this study, an EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria for in situ production in chickpea sourdough was isolated. After several backsloppings of the spontaneously fermented chickpea flour dough, a dominant strain of Weissella confusa was isolated and identified. W. confusa Ck15 was able to produce linear dextran with 2.6% α-(1 → 3) linked branches, from sucrose. Temperature of 30 °C, dough yield of 333, and 2% of sucrose addition were used to produce fermented chickpea sourdoughs. The acidification and rheology of the sourdoughs inoculated with W. confusa Ck15, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM 20193, as positive control, and Lactobacillus plantarum F8, as negative control, were compared. The in situ dextran production by W. confusa Ck15 fermentation led to the highest viscosity increase (5.90 Pa·s) and the highest EPS percentage in the doughs (1.49%), compared to the other doughs. The in situ dextran production represents a potential approach for improving the use of legume flour in bakery products; overall, this experiment represents a first step for the exploitation of microbial EPS for setting up a baking process for chickpea based product.

Cuisinomics: MS-based untargeted approach reveals chemical modulation by a recipe during home cooking.	33288173	Most of daily eaten food are cooked, which helps in absorbing nutrients and phytochemicals, but at the same time it can decrease its content. Currently, the impact of cooking has been studied that could influence food health related compounds, but they have a limited view of compounds by not consider molecular structural modifications and new compounds formation. An untargeted approach using LC-ESI-LQT-Orbitrap-MS/MS and univariate/multivariate statistical analysis was applied to understand how the preparation of a recipe, varying its ingredients (olive oil, 5-10%; onion, 20-40%; and garlic, 2-4%) and cooking time, could modulate the chemical profile of a tomato sofrito sauce. The presence of unexplored compounds that may have a beneficial effect on health, such as phytoprostanes, hydroxycinnamic acid amides and compounds such as 3,4 dihydroxyphenylglycone was revealed. Moreover, cooking was able to modulate the content of compounds like aminoacids, thiosulfates or phenolics and could be used as a tool to increase these molecules. The untargeted approach on cooking allows to use a recipe as a tool to improve a chemical profile of a dish, which opens the view for new dietary recommendations by cuisine to improve our diet, habits and health.

Effects of fat/oil type and ethylcellulose on the gel characteristic of pork batter.	33288174	The effects of fat/oil type (pork fat; sunflower seed, peanut, corn and flaxseed oils) and ethylcellulose (EC) concentration (8%, 10% and 12%) on the gel characteristic of pork batter were investigated in this study. Replacing pork fat in meat batter with organogels prepared with EC and vegetable oils obtained cooked batters with higher hardness, gumminess and chewiness, furthermore, increasing EC level in the organogels increased hardness, while cohesiveness and springiness showed no significant changes. Emulsion stability of all organogels groups was improved compared to pork fat group and the type of vegetable oil affected the emulsion stability. A shorter relaxation time T2 and a larger peak area P22 were observed for batters formulated with oraganogels, which indicated higher percentage of immobilized water. The batters prepared with pork fat displayed larger fat globules, lower L* value than those prepared with organogels, but the redness (a* values) had no significant difference.	EC	 ethylcellulose
Identification of key metabolites based on non-targeted metabolomics and chemometrics analyses provides insights into bitterness in Kucha [Camellia kucha (Chang et Wang) Chang].	33288175	Camellia kucha (Chang et Wang) Chang is a special tea in China, which is extremely bitter but beneficial for human health. However, there are no systematic studies on Kucha metabolites, especially those associated with bitterness. In this study, a non-targeted metabolomics approach based on UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS was applied to comprehensively profile the characteristic metabolites of two Kucha cultivars by comparison with three common tea cultivars. A total of 90 differential metabolites were identified. Among them, eight key metabolites (theacrine, 2,4-dimethyl-1H-indole, EGCG, dihydrokaempferol, panasenoside, 3-cresotinic acid, 3-methylglutaconic acid, and L-histidine) were more abundant in Kucha than in the controls, most of which were positively correlated with bitterness. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of some important catechins and alkaloids by HPLC implied absolutely higher concentrations of EGCG and theacrine in Kucha, which was similar to the metabolomics results. These results will be contribute to future research on the bitter and nutritional properties of Kucha.	ĠUHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS	 human health
Melatonin delays leaf senescence of postharvest Chinese flowering cabbage through ROS homeostasis.	33288176	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger and accelerate leaf senescence. Melatonin, a low molecular compound with several biological functions in plants, is known to delay leaf senescence in different species, including Chinese flowering cabbage. However, the mechanism(s) underpinning melatonin-delayed leaf senescence remains unclear. Here, we found that melatonin lowered the expression of chlorophyll catabolic genes (BrPAO and BrSGR1) and senescence-associated genes (BrSAG12 and BrSEN4), decreased chlorophyll loss, minimized the alteration in Fv/Fm ratio and remarkably delayed senescence of Chinese flowering cabbage after harvest. Moreover, the over-accumulation of O2•-, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde contents and the expression of respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) genes (BrRbohB, BrRbohC, BrRbohD, BrRbohD2 and BrRbohE) were significantly inhibited by melatonin treatment. Melatonin-treated cabbages also showed higher O2•-, OH• and DPPH radical scavenging capacity and enhanced activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and their gene expressions. Up-regulation of key components of ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle, the metabolic pathway that detoxify H2O2, was also observed in melatonin-treated cabbages. These findings suggest that melatonin-delayed postharvest leaf senescence of postharvest Chinese flowering cabbage may be mediated, at least in part, by maintaining ROS homeostasis through restraining RBOHs-catalyzed ROS production and enhancing the activity of ROS-scavenging system including major antioxidant enzymes and AsA-GSH cycle.

Reliability of LipidSearch software identification and its application to assess the effect of dry salting on the long-chain free fatty acid profile of tilapia muscles.	33288177	Dry salting has important effects on food lipids. In this work, the reliability of LipidSearch software identification and its application to assess the effect of dry salting on the long-chain free fatty acid profile of tilapia muscles were studied by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Extractive Orbitrap mass spectrometry and LipidSearch software. Compared with the standard reference identification method, the LipidSearch software identification method was suggested to be a reliable identification method for long-chain free fatty acid identification. During the dry salting process, tilapia muscles with low muscle-to-salt mass ratios of 3-8 might have stable and similar free fatty acid profile changes, and the free fatty acid amounts decreased and then increased with time. This work could provide useful information to evaluate the development and application of LipidSearch software as well as a way to analyze the effect of dry salting on the free fatty acids change of aquatic products.

Bilayer edible films with tunable humidity regulating property for inhibiting browning of Agaricus bisporus.	33288178	Bilayer edible films were fabricated with the stacking double layers, in which the outer and inner layer was consisted of hydrophobic ethyl cellulose and hydrophilic carboxymethyl chitosan hydrogel, respectively. Humidity regulating performance of the films varied with the change of substitution degree of carboxymethyl chitosan. The mechanical properties, water insolubility, water vapor permeability, water contact angle, moisture absorption/desorption characteristics and micro morphology of the film were characterized, which showed that the film can adjust the relative humidity and block the external moisture. The film prepared by carboxymethyl chitosan with the substitution degree of 120% was then selected for the packaging of fresh mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus). The browning of the mushrooms during storage was delayed, as well as the qualities were maintained well, Additionally, the activities and corresponding gene expression of PPO enzyme were inhibited, however for PAL enzyme, an increase was observed.

Metabolomic understanding of pod removal effect in soybean plants and potential association with their health benefit.	33288179	Since natural materials, such as phytochemicals in plants, are increasingly being used for foods and skincare due to their beneficial functions, it is important for developing the cultivation practices to increase the contents of phytochemicals. We here explored metabolite perturbations in the leaves of soybean plants when their pods were removed during growth through 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. There were obvious metabolic differences in the leaves between normal and pod-removed soybean plants. High amounts of primary metabolites in pod-removed soybean leaves, including amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids, reflected a delay of leaf senescence caused by pod removal. In particular, amounts of isoflavones, coumestrol, and apigenin derivatives in pod-removed soybean leaves were substantially increased. These were considered as distinct metabolic influences of pod removal in soybean plants. These results indicate that pod removal of soybean plants can induce significant perturbations of various metabolites in their soybean leaves, providing useful information to improve the quality of soybean leaves by increasing amounts of bioactive components.

Hybrid oil-in-water emulsions applying wax(lecithin)-based structured oils: Tailoring interface properties.	33288180	This study addressed the impact of fruit wax(lecithin)-based oleogels as dispersed phase in formation and stability of oil-in-water emulsions. These hybrid emulsions were prepared above the melting point of the oleogels, using Tween 80 (T80) or whey protein isolate (WPI) as emulsifiers. Both mono- and mixed-component oleogels comprised of fruit wax (FW) or FW + lecithin (FWLEC), respectively, were studied as lipid phases. After hot-homogenization, emulsions were submitted to quiescent cooling and stored over 14 days at 5 or 25 °C, in such temperatures supposed to assist or hinder oleogelation, respectively. Time course promoted a slight decrease in zeta potential only for WPI-stabilized emulsions and particle size distribution was shifted to larger size values, but showing a lesser extent to those stored at 5 °C. The presence of oleogels improved kinetic stability of emulsions compared to liquid oil at both temperatures, disclosing the role of the combined effects of the type of emulsifier and oleogelator(s)-emulsifier interactions. These outcomes are associated with the interfacial activity played by both oleogelators, but mainly lecithin that led to lower values of interfacial tension. In addition FWLEC combined with WPI showed the lowest complex modulus from dilational rheology, which can be related with WPI-LEC complex formation. Overall, results suggest that oleogelators migrated to the O/W interface of dispersed droplets, no longer reflecting oleogel bulk properties and showing a more complex behavior. However, the formation of more complex structures at the interface favored greater stability of the emulsions. Thus, the new perspective of oleogel-inspired fat droplets in hybrid systems can expand the conventional approach of oil structuring to create mixed interfaces tailoring oil-in-water emulsions properties.

Integrated analysis of the transcriptome, metabolome and analgesic effect provide insight into potential applications of different parts of Lindera aggregata.	33288181	Lindera aggregata(L. aggregata) is a wild shrub growing in the forests of Southeast Asia, whose main bioactive constituents are isoquinoline alkaloids. They are widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries. The studies on the metabolites and biosynthesis pathways inL. aggregata remain poorly understood. Nine isoquinoline alkaloid compounds were identified by UPLC Triple TOF-MS/MS in this study. Except for N-methyllaurotetanine, most isoquinoline alkaloid compounds were widely distributed in various parts ofL. aggregata and accumulated preferentially in roots than in leaves. Transcriptome data showed that several isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic genes, such as TyrAT, PPO, TDC, and SOMT, were identified to play important roles in generating differential metabolites in roots and leaves ofL. aggregata. Concentration-dependent analgesic effects and toxic effects of them were demonstrated in zebrafish experiments, and the overall ranking was JRAL > TRAL > LAL. The results of this study would provide useful information for the synthesis mechanisms of isoquinoline alkaloids inL. aggregata, and provide valuable information for the application of traditional non-medicinal parts ofL. aggregata in food and pharmaceutical industries.

Correlations between microbiota with physicochemical properties and volatile flavor components in black glutinous rice wine fermentation.	33288182	Black glutinous rice wine (BGRW) is a popular traditional Chinese rice wine; however, the flavors profiles associated with microbiota changes during its fermentation have not yet been evaluated. In this study, we explored the correlations between microbial communities with physicochemical properties and flavor components during BGRW fermentation. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify the microbial community composition of BGRW at different fermentation stages, and physicochemical properties and volatile flavor compounds (VFCs) were identified via fermentation features testing and headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry. First, we revealed Pantoea and Kosakonia predominated bacterial genera the early stage of BGRW fermentation, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus predominated bacterial genera the later stage, while Rhizopus and Saccharomyces were the predominant fungal genera throughout fermentation. Second, total sugars, titratable acids, pH, ethanol, amino acid nitrogen, and 43 VFCs were detected during fermentation. Twenty-three VFCs were differentially produced according to the linear discriminant analysis effect size method. With the increase of the fermentation time, the kinds and contents of esters and alcohols were also increased, while acids decreased. Moreover, 12 microbial genera, Lactococcus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Cronobacter, Pantoea, Weissella, Enterococcus, Rhizopus, Myceliophthora, Cystofilobasidium, and Aspergillus were found to be highly correlated (|ρ| > 0.7 and P < 0.05) with physicochemical properties and VFCs, by redundancy analysis (RDA) and two-way orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) analysis. Ultimately, based on the results, a metabolic map of dominant genera in BGRW was established. Our findings provided detailed information on the dynamic changes of physicochemical properties and VFCs and selection of beneficial strains to improve the quality of BGRW.

Rheology of carbohydrate blends close to the glass transition: Temperature and water content dependence of the viscosity in relation to fragility and strength.	33288183	Several modifications of the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation that incorporate the water-content dependence of the viscosity are introduced and applied to the fitting the zero-shear viscosity of a systematic series of maltopolymer-maltose blends for water contents w between 4% and 70% (M. Dupas-Langlet et al., Carbohydrate Polymers 213 (2019) 147-158). These models include a previously published model that addresses the water-content dependence of the viscosity via a Gordon-Taylor-type modification of the C2 coefficient of the WLF equation. New models that are based on two simple assumptions are introduced: 1. The viscosity at the glass transition temperature Tg decreases exponentially with the water content and 2. The WLF coefficient C2 depends linearly on the water content. The modified WLF models allow to extract the so-called isoviscosity lines, that connect points of varying temperature and water content that are characterized by the same viscosity. Based on data obtained between T = -15 °C and 70 °C using shear rheology (w = 30-70% w/w) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (w = 4-9% w/w), we conclude that the models provide a good fit of the experimental data, and that additional data, specifically very close to the glass transition line, is needed, to assess the hypotheses underlying the various modified WLF models. It is established that the viscosity at Tg is dependent on the composition and decreases with the content of maltose and water. The modified WLF models are used to determine Angell's fragility parameter m and Roos' strength parameter S. m and S are observed to increase, respectively decrease with increasing water and maltose content, signifying an increasing temperature dependence of the viscosity close to Tg with decreasing diluent content. The application of the isoviscosity concept to unit operations in the food and pharmaceutical industry is discussed. Specifically, we show how to analyze atomization, agglomeration, sintering and compaction using the isoviscosity concept.	ĠWLF	 water-content

The study was carried out by feeding daily two concentrations (100 and 200 mg/Kg BW) of propolis or bee pollen (or their combination to normal (non-diabetic) and diabetic rats for a period of 16 weeks. In vivo biochemical changes associated to diabetes are induced by drinking a solution containing 10% of D-glucose (diabetic rats). The in vitro antioxidant activity was also evaluated and the chemical composition of propolis and bee pollen extracts was determined by UHPLC-DAD. Phytochemical composition of propolis and bee pollen revealed the presence of several natural antioxidants, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonoids, flavan-3-ols and stilbens. The major antioxidant compound present in propolis was Naringin (290.19 ± 0.2 mg/Kg) and in bee pollen was apigenin (162.85 ± 17.7 mg/Kg). These results have been related with a high antioxidant activity, more intense in propolis extract. In rats, the administration of D-glucose had induced hyperglycemia (13.2 ± 0.82 mmol/L), increased plasmatic insulin levels (25.10 ± 2.12 U/L) and HOMA-IR index (14.72 ± 0.85) accompanied with dyslipidemia, elevation of hepatic enzyme levels, and a change in both serum renal biomarkers and plasmatic calcium. The co-administration of propolis and bee pollen extracts alone or in combination restored these biochemical parameters and attenuated the deleterious effects of D-glucose on liver and kidney functions. Furthermore, these effects were better attenuated in the combined therapy-prevented diabetic rats. Hence, it is possible to conclude that propolis and bee pollen can be used as a preventive natural product against diabetes induced dyslipidemia and hepato-renal damage.

Mapping the variability in physical, cooking, and nutritional properties of Zamnè, a wild food in Burkina Faso.	33288185	Zamnè is an Acacia seed used as a terroir food in Burkina Faso. It has been introduced as a famine-resilience crop and has become a cultural diet. However, little is known about its culinary and nutritional properties. This study aimed to explore the cooking and nutritional properties of Zamnè (Senegalia macrostachya (Reichenb. ex DC.) Kyal. & Boatwr.). Zamnè presented characteristics of medium size, flattened, dry, and hard-to-cook legume. The moisture, cylindrical ratio, diameter, thickness, weight, true density, coat percentage, coat thickness, and cooking time of the seeds were in the range of 4.5-5.8%, 1.1, 7.4-8.0 mm, 1.6-1.8 mm, 65.0-76.4 mg, 1.1 g/ml, 16.8-22.2%, 9.0-11.9 mg/cm2, and 180 min, respectively. The raw Zamnè showed 39.8-43.6, 9.7-11.5, 16.6-29.4, 13.3-20.2, 16.6-26.4, and 3.7-3.9 (g/100 g dry weight) of protein, fat, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, digestible carbohydrate, and ash contents, respectively. The traditional cooking process improved most of the parameters determining the proximate compositions but resulted in 51-52% of protein and 47-50% carbohydrate losses into the cooking wastewater. Besides, pseudoZamnè, a famine-emergency crop similar to Zamnè, revealed inferior cooking quality than Zamnè. The data reported here provide a basis for alternative cooking techniques and further investigations of Zamnè and pseudoZamnè seeds' nutritional quality.	ĠZamnÃ¨	 crop

The gut microbiota alteration and the key bacteria in Astragalus polysaccharides (APS)-improved osteoporosis.	33288186	Osteoporosis is a worldwide epidemic, and certain functional foods can alleviate osteoporosis with great efficiency. Here, in a dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis rat model, it was proved that APS could restore the bone mineral density (BMD) and repair the impairment of bone microarchitecture, two major features of osteoporosis. In APS-treated rats, acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-2) were significantly decreased. This suggested that APS might improve osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and preventing inflammation. Further analysis on the bacterial community revealed that the structure of gut microbiota was dramatically changed by APS, and 13 bacteria (such as c_Bacteroidia, p_Bacteroidetes, and g_Allpprevotella) could serve as biomarkers for APS-improved osteoporosis. Furthermore, five genera (uncultured_bacterium_f_Ruminococcaceae, Alloprevotella, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Blautia and Lactobacillus) were inferred as the key bacteria in APS-improved osteoporosis. In conclusion, APS-modified gut microbiota and the potential key bacteria to alleviate osteoporosis, as well as its relationship with improved osteoporosis, were investigated in our present study. Our results will help to understand how APS improves osteoporosis by regulating gut microbiota and contribute to the development and application of functional foods to alleviate refractory osteoporosis by regulating targeted intestinal bacteria.

Gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine-N-oxide: A bridge between dietary fatty acid and cardiovascular disease?	33288187	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a serious disease that endangers human health and is one of the leading causes of death. Recent studies have reported that gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of CVD, especially its metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Dietary precursors, such as choline, L-carnitine, phosphatidylcholine and betaine were metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA) under the action of gut microbiota, and subsequently oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMOs) to form TMAO. Dietary fat is one of three major nutrients in food, has been found to have a positive or negative effect on the development of CVD. Multiple clinical and experimental evidences suggested that dietary fatty acids (FAs) can affect TMAO production through gut microbiota and/or FMO3 enzyme activity. This article summarizes the existing gut microbiota-mediated reduction of TMA, discusses the molecular mechanism of dietary FAs in the pathobiology of CVD from the view of TMAO. Therefore, this review provides new insight into the association of dietary FAs and CVD, paving the way for dietary FAs therapy for CVD.	FAs	 fatty acids

Impact of microfluidization and thermal treatment on the structure, stability and in vitro digestion of curcumin loaded zein-propylene glycol alginate complex nanoparticles.	33288189	The aim of this study was to modulate the physicochemical properties, molecular interactions and microstructure of zein-propylene glycol alginate (PGA) complex nanoparticles for delivery of curcumin with the aid of high pressure microfluidization (HPM) (50-150 MPa) and thermal treatment (45-85 °C). The size of zein-PGA complex nanoparticles was decreased to around 300 nm. It was confirmed that the pressure of 100 MPa and temperature of 75 °C were the optimum parameters to provide a better protection of entrapped curcumin against environmental stresses. The electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic attraction were the dominant driving forces in the formation of the complex nanoparticles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed that HPM and thermal treatment facilitated the complex nanoparticles to form a more uniform size and spherical shape. During in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, zein-PGA complex nanoparticles showed excellent gastric stability and sustained-release of curcumin in the small intestine. HPM and thermal treatment showed a synergistic effect on enhancing the bioaccessibility of curcumin entrapped in zein-PGA complex nanoparticles. The findings revealed the influence of HPM and thermal treatment on functional attributes of the complex nanoparticles, which could be utilized to design food grade nanoparticles with desirable stability and digestive properties.

Comparative study of thermal processing on the physicochemical properties and prebiotic effects of the oat β-glucan by in vitro human fecal microbiota fermentation.	33288190	This study aimed to compare the prebiotic effects of oat β-glucan between steaming and microwave processing by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that microwave-processed oat β-glucan with lower average molecular weight (Mw) exhibited a more significant effect in promoting Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium compared with steaming processed oat β-glucan with higher Mw at the genus level. The overall microbial composition structure results indicated that the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Dialister exhibited significant differences between the samples (p < 0.05). Additionally, the short-chain fatty acid in microwave-processed oat β-glucan fermentation slurries significantly increased (p < 0.05), and more butyrate was produced from microwave-processed oat β-glucan, which may be attributed to the higher levels of Blautia and Dialister as butyrate-producers. These results suggest that microwave processing contributed to the degradation of oat β-glucan and enhanced its prebiotic function.	Mw	 molecular weight
Macamides: A review of structures, isolation, therapeutics and prospects.	33288191	Macamides, the major bioactive compounds of Lepidium meyenii (Walp.) or Maca, are a unique class of non-polar, long chain fatty acid N-benzylamides with fertility-enhancing, neuroprotective, neuro-modulatory, anti-fatigue and anti-osteoporosis effects. However, the relationship between the structures and pharmacological effects of macamides have not been established so far. In addition, little is known regarding their biosynthetic pathways and the mechanisms underlying the biological activities. In this review, we have summarized the methods currently used for the extraction, purification and synthesis of macamides. Their pharmacological effects, clinical prospects and biomedical applications have also been discussed. Current data strongly suggest that macamides are a promising bio-active agent, and further studies are warranted to elucidate their mechanisms of action.	Walp	 Lepidium meyenii
Determination of the microbial communities of Guizhou Suantang, a traditional Chinese fermented sour soup, and correlation between the identified microorganisms and volatile compounds.	33288192	Guizhou Suantang (GZST), a type of sour soup, is a traditional fermented food that can be classified into Hong Suantang (HST) and Bai Suantang (BST). GZST possesses unique flavors arising from various microbiota in fermentation ecosystems. However, the association between these microbiota and flavors remains poorly understood. Accordingly, this study analyzed the volatile components and microbial communities of GZST via headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-throughput 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer sequencing techniques. Results showed that 133 compounds, including alcohols, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes, nitriles, acids, and sulfides, were identified from GZST. Moreover, principal component analysis found significant variances in the composition of volatile compounds among different samples. The bacterial genus level indicated that all GZST samples were dominated by Lactobacillus. At the fungal genus level, BST was dominated by Pichia, Debaryomyces, Mortierella, unclassified, Meyerozyma, and Dipodascus. Meanwhile, HST was dominated by Pichia, Candida, Kazachstania, Debaryomyces, Archaeorhizomyces, and Verticillium. The potential correlations between microbiota and volatile components were also explored through bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares-based correlation analysis. Nine bacterial genera and eight fungal taxa were identified as functional core microbiota for flavor production on the basis of their dominance and functionality in the microbial community. In addition, excessive Lactobacillus inhibited the formation of certain flavor substances. These findings provided basic data for the isolation, screening, and fermentation regulation of functional microorganisms in GZST. The information provided in this study is valuable for the development of effective strategies for selecting beneficial bacterial and fungal strains to improve the quality of GZST.	BST	 Bai Suantang

Naturally occurring low molecular peptides identified in egg white show antioxidant activity.	33288194	Egg white is a rich source of bioactive proteins that are essential to provide protection to the embryo in yolk. There is an ongoing interest in identifying novel egg white proteins; it is not known however if peptides are also present in egg white. The objectives of the study were to identify low molecular peptides occurring naturally in egg white using a peptidomics approach and to determine their potential antioxidant activity. A total of 45 peptides were identified but surprisingly all are originated from egg white minor proteins (except ovotransferrin); three most abundant peptides, STDVPRDPWVWGSAHPQAQHTR, GDPSAWSWGAEAHS, and ALGEDIVDLDSFSEQH are derived from ovocleidin, zona pellucida glycoprotein C (ZPC), and sulfhydryl oxidase 1, respectively. Neuropeptide Y was identified for the first time in egg whites. The concentrations of eight most abundant peptides in egg white ranged from 0.004 to 0.292 mg/g, determined by triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Six peptides were found to have antioxidant activities based on reduced formation of superoxide and increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in cells. Our study provided evidence on the presence of naturally occurring antioxidant peptides in egg white.	CAT	 catalase

Neuropeptide Y was identified for the first time in egg whites. The concentrations of eight most abundant peptides in egg white ranged from 0.004 to 0.292 mg/g, determined by triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Six peptides were found to have antioxidant activities based on reduced formation of superoxide and increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in cells. Our study provided evidence on the presence of naturally occurring antioxidant peptides in egg white.	MRM	 multiple-reaction monitoring
Naturally occurring low molecular peptides identified in egg white show antioxidant activity.	33288194	Egg white is a rich source of bioactive proteins that are essential to provide protection to the embryo in yolk.

Food restriction reduces cortical bone mass and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels and promotes uterine atrophy in mice.	33288195	Low energy availability in female athletes often causes hypothalamic amenorrhea and osteoporosis, in turn promoting stress fractures. Mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear. Here we show that model mice subjected to food restriction (FR) or FR-plus-voluntary running exercise exhibit significantly reduced bone mineral density, cortical bone parameters and uterine weight than do control mice, and that these parameters worsen in the FR-plus-exercise group. Relative to controls, FR and FR-plus-exercise groups showed significantly lower mineral apposition rate and osteoclast number and significantly reduced serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) levels. Outcomes were rescued by ED71 or 1.25(OH)2D3 treatment. Thus, we conclude that administration of active vitamin D analogues represents a possible treatment to prevent these conditions.

Quantitative structural analysis of glycans expressed within tumors derived from pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenograft mouse models.	33288196	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an intractable malignancy for which novel therapeutic targets are in high demand. To uncover glycans expressed within PDAC, we previously performed glycome profiling of PDAC cell lines using lectin microarray and found that the lectin rBC2LCN with specificity to a Fucα1-2Galβ1-3 motif exhibited strong binding to a PDAC cell line (Capan-1) and to all tumor tissues derived from 69 pancreatic cancer patients. Nevertheless, no information was available as to whether glycans containing the Fucα1-2Galβ1-3 motif are expressed within PDAC. Here we used HPLC combined with MALDI-TOFMS to perform a structural and quantitative glycome analysis targeting both N- and O-glycans derived from two types of patient-derived PDAC xenograft mouse models, PC3 (well-differentiated) and PC42 (poorly-differentiated). A higher percentage of highly branched and sialylated complex-type N-glycans was detected in PC42 relative to PC3. The percentage of core 1 O-glycans was higher in PC42 relative to PC3, whereas that of core 3 O-glycans was higher in PC3. Cancer-related glycan epitopes such as Lewis A and Lewis Y were detected in core 3 O-glycans of both PC3 and PC42. H-type3 containing the Fucα1-2Galβ1-3 motif was detected in Core 2 O-glycans in both models, explaining the molecular mechanism of the binding of rBC2LCN to PDAC.

RNAi mediated silencing of Nanog expression suppresses the growth of human colorectal cancer stem cells.	33288197	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world known for its poor recurrence-free prognosis. Previous studies have shown that it is closely linked with cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have self-renewal potential and the capacity to differentiate into diverse populations. Nanog is an important transcription factor that functions to maintain the self-renewal and proliferation of embryonic stem cells; however, many recent studies have shown that Nanog is also highly expressed in many cancer stem cells. To investigate whether Nanog plays a crucial role in maintaining the stemness of colorectal CSCs, RNA interference was used to downregulate Nanog expression in the CRC stem cell line, EpCAM+CD44+HCT-116 cells (CCSCs). We examined the anti-tumor function of Nanog in vitro and in vivo, using small interfering RNA. Our results revealed that the Nanog mRNA expression level in CCSCs was higher than that in HCT-116 cells. We found that the depletion of Nanog inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in CCSCs. In addition, the invasive ability of CCSCs was markedly restricted when Nanog was silenced by small interfering RNA. Furthermore, we found that the silencing of Nanog decreased tumor size and weight and improved the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, these findings collectively demonstrate that Nanog, which is highly expressed in CRC stem cells, is a key factor in the development of tumor growth, and it may serve as a potential marker of prognosis and a novel and effective therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.

Mutagenesis and structure-based analysis of the role of Tryptophan525 of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase from Pseudomonas nitroreducens.	33288198	γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-glutamyl compounds and the transfer of their γ-glutamyl moiety to acceptor substrates. Pseudomonas nitroreducens GGT (PnGGT) is used for the industrial synthesis of theanine, thus it is important to determine the structural basis of hydrolysis and transfer reactions and identify the acceptor site of PnGGT to improve the efficient of theanine synthesis. Our previous structural studies of PnGGT have revealed that crucial interactions between three amino acid residues, Trp385, Phe417, and Trp525, distinguish PnGGT from other GGTs. Here we report the role of Trp525 in PnGGT based on site-directed mutagenesis and structural analyses. Seven mutant variants of Trp525 were produced (W525F, W525V, W525A, W525G, W525S, W525D, and W525K), with substitution of Trp525 by nonaromatic residues resulting in dramatically reduced hydrolysis activity. All Trp525 mutants exhibited significantly increased transfer activity toward hydroxylamine with hardly any effect on acceptor substrate preference. The crystal structure of PnGGT in complex with the glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, revealed that Trp525 is a key residue limiting the movement of water molecules within the PnGGT active site.

Emodin ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys by inhibiting EZH2.	33288199	Emodin, a major component of Chinese herbal rhubarb, delays the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the effect and working mechanisms of Emodin on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis remains elusive. We hypothesized that emodin inhibits renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis through EZH2, a histone methyltransferase. Our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that emodin reduced extracellular collagen deposition and inhibited Smad3 and CTGF pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, which were correlated with the down-regulation of EZH2 and reduced trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3k27me3) in NRK-49F fibrotic cells and UUO kidneys. Inhibition of EZH2 by 3-DZNeP blocked or attenuated the anti-fibrotic effect of emodin in UUO kidneys and NRK-49F cells. These data indicate that emodin inhibits renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys and this effect is mediated through EZH2.	H3k27me3	 trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27

Reconstruction of proximal humeral fractures without screws using a reinforced bone substitute.	33288210	"Multi-fragment fractures are still a challenge: current clinical practice relies on plates and screws. Treatment of fractures of the proximal humerus has the intra-operative risk of articular damage when inserting multiple screws. Distal-varus collapse of the head is a frequent complication in osteoporotic patients. The aim of this biomechanical study was to investigate if an Innovative-cement-technique (the screws are replaced by injection of cement) provides the same or better stability of the reconstructed head compared to the Standard-technique (locking screws). A four-fragment fracture was simulated in twelve pairs of humeri, with removal of part of the cancellous bone to simulate osteoporotic ""eggshell"" defect. One humerus of each pair was repaired either with a Standard-technique (locking plate, 2 cortical and 6 locking screws), or with the Innovative-cement-technique (injection of a partially-resorbable reinforced bone substitute consisting of PMMA additivated with 26% beta-TCP). Cement injection was performed both in the lab and under fluoroscopic monitoring. The reconstructed specimens were tested to failure with a cyclic force of increasing amplitude. The Innovative-cement-technique withstood a force 3.57 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions before failure started. The maximum force before final collapse for the Innovative-cement-technique was 3.56 times larger than the contralateral Standard-technique. These differences were statistically significant. The Innovative-cement-technique, based on the reinforced bone substitute, demonstrated better biomechanical properties compared to the Standard-technique. These findings, along with the advantage of avoiding the possible complications associated with the locking screws, may help safer and more effective treatment in case of osteoporotic multi-fragment humeral fractures."

Imaging of COVID-19: CT, MRI, and PET.	33288215	Soon after reports of a novel coronavirus capable of causing severe pneumonia surfaced in late 2019, expeditious global spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) forced the World Health Organization to declare an international state of emergency. Although best known for causing symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in mild cases and fulminant pneumonia in severe disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also been associated with gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiac, and hematologic presentations. Despite concerns over poor specificity and undue radiation exposure, chest imaging nonetheless remains central to the initial diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 progression, as well as to the evaluation of complications. Classic features on chest CT include ground-glass and reticular opacities with or without superimposed consolidations, frequently presenting in a bilateral, peripheral, and posterior distribution. More recently, studies conducted with MRI have shown excellent concordance with chest CT in visualizing typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. For patients in whom exposure to ionizing radiation should be avoided, particularly pregnant patients and children, pulmonary MRI may represent a suitable alternative to chest CT. Although PET imaging is not typically considered among first-line investigative modalities for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, numerous reports have noted incidental localization of radiotracer in parenchymal regions of COVID-19-associated pulmonary lesions. These findings are consistent with data from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV cohorts which suggested an ability for 18F-FDG PET to detect subclinical infection and lymphadenitis in subjects without overt clinical signs of infection. Though highly sensitive, use of PET/CT for primary detection of COVID-19 is constrained by poor specificity, as well as considerations of cost, radiation burden, and prolonged exposure times for imaging staff. Even still, decontamination of scanner bays is a time-consuming process, and proper ventilation of scanner suites may additionally require up to an hour of downtime to allow for sufficient air exchange. Yet, in patients who require nuclear medicine investigations for other clinical indications, PET imaging may yield the earliest detection of nascent infection in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Especially for patients with concomitant malignancies and other states of immunocompromise, prompt recognition of infection and early initiation of supportive care is crucial to maximizing outcomes and improving survivability.

In silico optimization of cancer therapies with multiple types of nanoparticles applied at different times.	33288217	Cancer tumors constitute a complicated environment for conventional anti-cancer treatments to confront, so solutions with higher complexity and, thus, robustness to diverse conditions are required. Alternations in the tumor composition have been documented, as a result of a conventional treatment, making an ensemble of cells drug resistant. Consequently, a possible answer to this problem could be the delivery of the pharmaceutic compound with the assistance of nano-particles (NPs) that modify the delivery characteristics and biodistribution of the therapy. Nonetheless, to tackle the dynamic response of the tumor, a variety of application times of different types of NPs could be a way forward.	NPs	 nano-particles

A novel fault tolerant control approach based on backstepping controller for a five phase induction motor drive: Experimental investigation.	33288220	The five phase induction motor (FPIM) is a very suitable choice for different industrial applications which require high reliability. This is due to the ability of the motor to keep operating even with open stator phases. However, to ensure the right operation and for achieving the desired dynamic performance in terms of reduced torque fluctuations, a fault tolerant control (FTC) methodology must be applied. Because of this, the paper introduces a novel FTC approach for the FPIM drive based on a backstepping controller. The derivation and explanation of the proposed technique are presented and analyzed in a systematic manner. The validation of the proposed FTC strategy has been carried out experimentally using a dSPACE 1104 control board. The test results approve the validity of the designed controller in achieving the control targets which ensures the highest system reliability of the drive that is mostly required in different automotive and industrial applications.

Swarm velocity guidance based distributed finite-time coordinated path-following for uncertain under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles.	33288222	This article mainly researches the problem of distributed finite-time coordinated path-following for under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) within a network swarm. Each vehicle in swarm system suffers from velocity restrictions and multiple uncertainties including parameter perturbations and time-varying environment disturbances. Based on the constructed bionic swarm pattern and potential function, the swarm velocity guidance (SVG) with self-organization and collision avoidance is developed to guide ASV surge velocities and heading angles simultaneously. A distributed observer by adding correction terms to the vehicle model is involved to identify the lumped uncertainties, and the estimations are utilized as feed-forward compensation to weaken the uncertainty impact, thus achieving high tracking precision. By using asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function, the uncertainty observer based distributed surge and heading kinetics controllers under physical restrictions are devised to guarantee that the guided signals generated by SVG are tracked within finite time. Through simulation studies of swarm path-following, it is demonstrated that the designed control approach is feasible and efficient for multiple uncertain under-actuated ASVs.

Based on the constructed bionic swarm pattern and potential function, the swarm velocity guidance (SVG) with self-organization and collision avoidance is developed to guide ASV surge velocities and heading angles simultaneously. A distributed observer by adding correction terms to the vehicle model is involved to identify the lumped uncertainties, and the estimations are utilized as feed-forward compensation to weaken the uncertainty impact, thus achieving high tracking precision. By using asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function, the uncertainty observer based distributed surge and heading kinetics controllers under physical restrictions are devised to guarantee that the guided signals generated by SVG are tracked within finite time. Through simulation studies of swarm path-following, it is demonstrated that the designed control approach is feasible and efficient for multiple uncertain under-actuated ASVs.

The association of γδ-T cells with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.	33288226	As the survival rate of premature infants increases, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic complication of premature infants, is also higher than before. The pathogenesis of BPD is complicated, and immune imbalance and inflammatory response may play important roles in it.	BPD	 bronchopulmonary dysplasia
Improvements in the predictive accuracy of the hydrophobic subtraction model of reversed-phase selectivity.	33288228	The hydrophobic subtraction model (HSM) for characterizing the selectivity of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) columns has been used extensively by the LC community since it was first developed in 2002. Continuing interest in the model is due in part to the large, publicly available set of column descriptors that has been assembled over the past 18 years. In the work described in this report, we sought to refine the HSM with the goal of improving the predictive accuracy of the model without compromising its physico-chemical interpretability. The approach taken here has the following facets. A set of retention measurements for 635 columns and the 16 probe solutes used to characterize new columns using the HSM was assembled. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used as a guide for the development of a refined version of the HSM. Several outlying columns (84) were eliminated from the analysis because they were either inconsistent with the PCA model or were outliers from the original HSM model. With the retention dataset for the 16 probe solutes on the remaining 551 columns, we determined that a six-component model is the most sophisticated form of the model that can be used without overfitting the data. In our refined version of the HSM, the S*σ term has been removed. Two new terms have been added, which more accurately account for the molecular volume of the solute (Vv), and the solute dipolarity (Dd), and the remaining terms have been adjusted to accommodate these changes. The refined model described here provides improved prediction of retention factors, with the model standard error being reduced from 1.0 for the original HSM to 0.35 for the refined model (16 solutes, 551 columns). Furthermore, the number of retention factors with errors greater than 10% are reduced from 231 to 25. A revised metric for column similarity, F, is also proposed as a part of this work.

Nuclear receptors: Key regulators of somatic cell functions in the ovulatory process.	33288229	The development of the ovarian follicle to its culmination by ovulation is an essential element of fertility. The final stages of ovarian follicular growth are characterized by granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation, and steroid synthesis under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The result is a population of granulosa cells poised to respond to the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH). Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors play indispensable roles in the regulation of these events. The key regulators of the final stages of follicular growth that precede ovulation from this family include the estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) and the androgen receptor (AR), with additional roles for others, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). Following the LH surge, the mural and cumulus granulosa cells undergo rapid changes that result in expansion of the cumulus layer, and a shift in ovarian steroid hormone biosynthesis from estradiol to progesterone production. The nuclear receptor best associated with these events is LRH-1. Inadequate cumulus expansion is also observed in the absence of AR and ESR2, but not the progesterone receptor (PGR). The terminal stages of ovulation are regulated by PGR, which increases the abundance of the proteases that are directly responsible for rupture. It further regulates the prostaglandins and cytokines associated with the inflammatory-like characteristics of ovulation. LRH-1 regulates PGR, and is also a key regulator of steroidogenesis, cellular proliferation, and cellular migration, and cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, nuclear receptors are among the panoply of transcriptional regulators with roles in ovulation, and several are necessary for normal ovarian function.	PGR	 progesterone receptor

Estimation of radiative forcing and heating rate based on vertical observation of black carbon in Nanjing, China.	33288247	Owing to a lack of vertical observations, the impacts of black carbon (BC) on radiative forcing (RF) have typically been analyzed using ground observations and assumed profiles. In this study, a UAV platform was used to measure high-resolution in-situ vertical profiles of BC, fine particles (PM2.5), and relevant meteorological parameters in the boundary layer (BL). Further, a series of calculations using actual vertical profiles of BC were conducted to determine its impact on RF and heating rate (HR). The results show that the vertical distributions of BC were strongly affected by atmospheric thermodynamics and transport. Moreover. Three main types of profiles were revealed: Type I, Type II, Type III, which correspond to homogenous profiles (HO), negative gradient profiles (NG), and positive gradient profiles (PG), respectively. Types I and II were related to the diurnal evolution of the BL, and Type III was caused by surrounding emissions from high stacks and regional transport. There were no obvious differences in RF calculated for HO profiles and corresponding surface BC concentrations, unlike for NG and PG profiles. RF values calculated using surface BC concentrations led to an overestimate of 13.2 W m-2 (27.5%, surface) and 18.2 W m-2 (33.4%, atmosphere) compared to those calculated using actual NG profiles, and an underestimate of approximately 15.4 W m-2 (35.0%, surface) and 16.1 W m-2 (29.9%, atmosphere) compared to those calculated using actual PG profiles. In addition, the vertical distributions of BC HR exhibited clear sensitivity to BC profile types. Daytime PG profiles resulted in a positive vertical gradient of HR, which may strengthen temperature inversion at high altitudes. These findings indicate that calculations that use BC surface concentrations and ignore the vertical distribution of BC will lead to substantial uncertainties in the effects of BC on RF and HR.

Sludge yield and degradation of suspended solids by a large pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor for the treatment of real municipal wastewater at 25 °C.	33288248	Sludge yield and suspended solid are important factors concerned in the anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater. In this study, a large pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was constructed for effectively treating real municipal wastewater at an ambient temperature of 25 °C. The sludge yield and the degradation of influent suspended solids were evaluated during the long-term operation of the AnMBR. This reactor with 5.0 m3 effective volume is the largest one-stage submerged AnMBR that has ever been used to treat municipal wastewater. During the long-term operation of 217 days, this AnMBR obtained excellent COD and BOD5 removal efficiency over 90%. Stable biogas production was also successfully obtained from treating municipal wastewater. The sludge yield of the AnMBR was approximately 0.19-0.26 g MLSS g-1 COD removed for the treatment of real municipal wastewater. The shortest SRT of the AnMBR was calculated as 29 days for an HRT of 6 h at an empirical MLSS of 10 g L-1. While the influent suspended solid (SS) contained in the municipal wastewater was completely removed by the AnMBR, only 57%-66% of the influent SS was degraded. The rest of influent SS was directly converted to MLSS instead of being degraded. The AnMBR maintained a stable membrane filtration using a hollow-fiber membrane with a total area of 72 m2, realizing a flux of 2.75-17.83 LMH, and the mean transmembrane pressure (TMP) was 0.9-23.5 kPa. An online chemical backwash cleaning system helped to lower the TMP timely using sodium hypochlorite and citric acid when the TMP increased rapidly and reached the rated limit of membrane. This is the first report on demonstrating the successful operation and detailed performance of a large pilot-scale AnMBR applied to the treatment of real municipal wastewater.

This reactor with 5.0 m3 effective volume is the largest one-stage submerged AnMBR that has ever been used to treat municipal wastewater. During the long-term operation of 217 days, this AnMBR obtained excellent COD and BOD5 removal efficiency over 90%. Stable biogas production was also successfully obtained from treating municipal wastewater. The sludge yield of the AnMBR was approximately 0.19-0.26 g MLSS g-1 COD removed for the treatment of real municipal wastewater. The shortest SRT of the AnMBR was calculated as 29 days for an HRT of 6 h at an empirical MLSS of 10 g L-1. While the influent suspended solid (SS) contained in the municipal wastewater was completely removed by the AnMBR, only 57%-66% of the influent SS was degraded. The rest of influent SS was directly converted to MLSS instead of being degraded. The AnMBR maintained a stable membrane filtration using a hollow-fiber membrane with a total area of 72 m2, realizing a flux of 2.75-17.83 LMH, and the mean transmembrane pressure (TMP) was 0.9-23.5 kPa. An online chemical backwash cleaning system helped to lower the TMP timely using sodium hypochlorite and citric acid when the TMP increased rapidly and reached the rated limit of membrane. This is the first report on demonstrating the successful operation and detailed performance of a large pilot-scale AnMBR applied to the treatment of real municipal wastewater.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediates benzo[a]pyrene-induced metabolic reprogramming in human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells.	33288249	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure accelerates the initiation and progression of lung cancer through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. However, how AHR reprograms metabolism related to the malignant transformation in of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-exposed lung cells remains unclear. After confirming that BaP exposure activated AHR signaling and relevant downstream factors and then promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition, an untargeted metabolomics approach was employed to discover AHR-mediated metabolic reprogramming and potential therapeutic targets in BaP-exposed BEAS-2B cells. We found that 52 metabolites were significantly altered in BaP-exposed BEAS-2B cells and responsive to resveratrol (RSV) intervention. Pathway analysis revealed that 28 and 30 metabolic pathways were significantly altered in response to BaP exposure and RSV intervention, respectively. Notably, levels of most amino acids were significantly decreased, while those of most fatty acids were significantly increased in BaP-exposed BEAS-2B cells, and above changes were abolished by RSV intervention. Besides, levels of amino acids and fatty acids were highly correlated with those of many metabolites and AHR signaling upon BaP exposure and RSV intervention (the absolute values of Pearson correlation coefficients above 0.8). We further discovered a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) A/G signaling and an increase in fatty acid import by the transporter FATP1 in BaP-exposed BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, inhibition of AHR signaling by CH-223191 abolished BaP-induced repression of PPARA/G signaling and activation of FATP1 in BEAS-2B cells, demonstrating the regulatory role of AHR signaling in fatty acid accumulation via mediating PPARA/G-FATP1 signaling. These data suggested amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, AHR and PPAR-FATP1 signaling as potential therapeutic targets for intervening BaP-induced toxicity and related diseases. As far as we known, fatty acid accumulation and high correlations of AHR signaling with amino acid and fatty acid metabolism are novel phenomena discovered in BaP-exposed lung epithelial cells.

Understanding the occurrence and distribution of emerging pollutants and endocrine disruptors in sensitive coastal South Florida Ecosystems.	33288250	Environmental exposure risk to different xenobiotics, which can potentially alter the function of the endocrine system, remains a great health and safety concern for aquatic species and humans. Steroid hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been identified as important aquatic contaminants due to their widespread occurrence in surface waters and their endocrine disrupting properties. Heavily populated areas in South Florida not served by municipal wastewater collection present an unexpected high risk of anthropogenic contaminants to nearby coastal systems through surface runoff and groundwater flow. Previous studies in South Florida have been largely concentrated on assessing the relevance of the fate and transport of inorganic nutrients, heavy metals and pesticides with regulatory criteria. Therefore, a significant gap exists in assessing occurrence, distribution and biological significance of the presence of human related organic contaminants in natural surface waters. In this study, we have developed a fast and sensitive online solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-HRMS) method using a Q-Exactive system for the determination of the occurrence and distribution of selected wastewater tracers/indicators, recalcitrant PPCPs and steroid hormones in South Florida surface waters. Seasonal and spatial variations of these contaminants were monitored from 2017 to 2019. The presence of total coliforms and E. coli were also evaluated in order to further assess water quality. Correlations between hormones and anthropogenic tracers were explored to better elucidate the sources, pathways and exposure risks to these contaminants. Caffeine, sucralose, Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and carbamazepine were frequently detected in the water samples, which is indicative of extensive wastewater intrusion impacting the surface water. Estrone (E1), 17-β-estradiol (E2), and 17-α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) levels found in surface water raises concern of potential endocrine disruption effects in the aquatic ecosystem.

A meta-analysis of heavy metal bioavailability response to biochar aging: Importance of soil and biochar properties.	33288251	Biochar has been widely applied to remediate the heavy metal-polluted soils, whereas biochar aging can induce the changes of the biochar physic-chemical properties. Afterwards, the bioavailability of heavy metals (BHM) will vary in soils which likely increase the unstable fractions of heavy metals and the following environmental risks. To explore the biochar aging effects on the BHM changes in responses to the variation of experimental conditions and biochar properties, a meta-analysis for the literatures published before May 2020 was conducted. A sum of 257 independent observations from 22 published papers was obtained. The results from the analysis of boosted regression tree showed that the soil pH was the most important factor influencing the BHM changes in biochar amended soil, followed by soil texture, aging time and biochar pyrolysis temperature. The results of this review showed that the BHM was decreased by 16.9%, 28.7% and 6.4% in weakly acid soil (pH 6.00-6.99), coarse- and medium-textured soils, respectively, but increased by 149% and 121% in the alkaline (pH > 8.00) and fine-textured soils. The BHM declined in the soils amended with biochar pyrolyzed at relative high temperature (> 500 °C), and increased during aging in soils amended with biochar pyrolyzed at relatively low temperature (401-500 °C). In terms of diverse immobilized heavy metals, only bioavailable Zn in soil decreased after aging. However, there was no significant changes in Cd, Cu and Pb's bioavalability. Besides, the BHM was decreased by 18.6% within the short-term (less than one year) biochar aging, while showed inverse trend during the longer aging processes. Besides, the application of lignin-enriched biochar may counteract the positive effects of the biochar aging on BHM. Our works may promote the interpretation of the interference factors on the BHM changes and filled the research gaps on biochar aging process in soils.	ĠBHM	 heavy

Microcystin-leucine arginine exposure contributes to apoptosis and follicular atresia in mice ovaries by endoplasmic reticulum stress-upregulated Ddit3.	33288253	Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR), an intracellular toxin to cause reproduction toxicity, is produced by blooming cyanobacteria and widely distributed in eutrophic waters. It is revealed that MC-LR-induced female reproductive toxicity is more severe than male reproductive toxicity. Previous studies mainly focused on male reproductive toxicity, and the molecular mechanisms of MC-LR-induced apoptosis, follicular atresia and infertility in female remain largely unclear. Here, it was found that MC-LR treatment could induce apoptosis, inflammation, follicular atresia, and decrease of gonadal index in mice ovaries. RNA-Seq data showed that the up-regulation of DNA-damage inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3) under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress had predominantly regulatory role in MC-LR-induced apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, MC-LR exposure promoted cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6, 50kd), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1) expression, phosphorylation of IRE1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (Map3k5) and Ddit3 expression, which was accompanied by the upregulation of death receptor 5 (Dr5) and active-caspase-3, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. ER stress inhibitor 4-Phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) ameliorated these MC-LR-induced changes in protein or mRNA level. More importantly, knockdown of Ddit3 suppressed MC-LR-induced cell apoptosis and follicular atresia by directly regulating Dr5 and Bcl-2. Additionally, it was also found that MC-LR increased Map3k5 phosphorylation by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, and then promoted Ddit3 expression. In short, our data suggests that Ddit3 promotes MC-LR-induced mice ovarian cells apoptosis and follicular atresia via ER stress activation, which provides a new insight into the relation between infertility in females and the emerging water pollutant MC-LR.

It is revealed that MC-LR-induced female reproductive toxicity is more severe than male reproductive toxicity. Previous studies mainly focused on male reproductive toxicity, and the molecular mechanisms of MC-LR-induced apoptosis, follicular atresia and infertility in female remain largely unclear. Here, it was found that MC-LR treatment could induce apoptosis, inflammation, follicular atresia, and decrease of gonadal index in mice ovaries. RNA-Seq data showed that the up-regulation of DNA-damage inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3) under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress had predominantly regulatory role in MC-LR-induced apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, MC-LR exposure promoted cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6, 50kd), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1) expression, phosphorylation of IRE1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (Map3k5) and Ddit3 expression, which was accompanied by the upregulation of death receptor 5 (Dr5) and active-caspase-3, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. ER stress inhibitor 4-Phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) ameliorated these MC-LR-induced changes in protein or mRNA level.

Application of low dosage of copper oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles boosts bacterial and fungal communities in soil.	33288254	With the expanding nanotechnology, nanoparticles (NPs) embedded products are used in the agricultural sector to improve soil fertility. Thus, two typical metal oxides NPs and their mixtures were applied in different doses to evaluate the impacts on soil microbes. CuO and ZnO NPs boosted soil microbial communities as reflected by the increased number of extractable bacterial or fungal groups and the enlarged values of Chao 1, ACE, and Shannon indices. Relative abundance of some susceptible taxa such as Sphingomonadales increased with increasing concentrations of ZnO NPs, while IMCC26256 decreased with increasing concentrations of CuO NPs. The mixture of CuO and ZnO NPs did not show more promotional effects on the soil bacterial community than the sum of individual effects. Increased soil organic carbon mitigated the impacts on soil bacteria for CuO NPs, but not for ZnO NPs. As micro-nutrients, the ions released from CuO and ZnO NPs had the potential to promote soil microbial community richness and diversity. However, the positive impacts of MNPs were impaired at dosage higher than 250 mg kg-1 soil (213.08 mg kg-1 soil of Cu, 162.73 mg kg-1 soil of Zn). Thus, the application dose and soil type other than the coexistence of MNPs should be considered before the wide use in increasing agricultural productivity.	NPs	 nanoparticles
Nitrogen removal and microbial community diversity in single-chamber electroactive biofilm reactors with different ratios of the cathode surface area to reactor volume.	33288255	Removal of nitrogen compounds is particularly important domestic wastewater treatment. Our recent study reported the successful removal of nitrogen in single-chamber electroactive biofilm reactors (EBRs) under aeration-free conditions. We hypothesized that the oxygen diffused from the air-cathode is a key factor in the removal of nitrogen in the EBR. If so, the effect of the penetrated oxygen would vary according to the ratio of the air-cathode surface area to the reactor volume (AV ratio) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT). In this study, single-chamber EBRs with three different AV ratios: 125 m2/m3 (EBR-125), 250 m2/m3 (EBR-250), and 500 m2/m3 (EBR-500) were evaluated for the removal of nitrogen under different HRTs of 0.5-6 h. The higher the AV ratio, the greater the increase in nitrification. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of EBR-125 and EBR-250 decreased as the HRT decreased, while that of EBR-500 increased. EBR-250 showed the highest TN removal (62.0%) with well-balanced nitrification (83.9%) and denitrification (75.1%) at an HRT of 6 h. However, EBR-500 appeared to be superior for practical application because it showed a comparable TN removal (59%) at a substantially short HRT of 1 h. The microbial communities that were involved in the nitrogen cycle varied according to whether the biofilms were located on the anodes, separators, and cathodes but were similar among EBRs with different AV ratios. Nitrifying bacteria were detected in the biofilms that were presented on the cathodes (approximately 7.8% of the total phylotypes), while denitrifying bacteria were mainly found in biofilm that were located on the anodes (approximately 23.3%). Anammox bacteria were also detected on the anode (approximately 3.7%) and in the separator biofilms (approximately 1.9%) of all the EBRs. These results suggest that both the A/V ratio and the HRT could affect the counter diffusion of substrates (NH4+ and organic compounds) and oxygen in the biofilms and allow interactions between a diversity of microorganisms for the successful removal of nitrogen in EBRs. These findings are expected to aid in the development of new applications using EBR for energy-saving wastewater treatment.	TN	 total nitrogen

Policy-driven changes in the health risk of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in China during 2013-2018.	33288256	China issued a series of control measures to mitigate PM2.5 pollution, including long-term (i.e., Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, APPCAP) and short-term (emergency measures in autumn and winter) acts. However, the O3 concentration increased significantly as PM2.5 levels sharply decreased when these measures were implemented. Therefore, the policy-driven positive/negative health effects of PM2.5/O3 need to be comprehensively estimated. The health impact function (HIF) is applied to evaluate the health burden attributable to long- and short-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results show that the PM2.5 concentration decreased by 42.95% in 74 cities, whereas O3 pollution is increased by 17.56% from 2013 to 2018. Compared with 2013, the number of premature deaths attributable to long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure decreased by almost 5.31 × 104 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87 × 104-4.71 × 104) (10.13%) and 3.00 × 104 (95% CI: 1.66 × 104-4.39 × 104) (72.49%), respectively, in 2018. In contrast, O3-attributable deaths, increased by 1.98 × 104 (95% CI: 0.31 × 104-3.59 × 104) (130.57%) and 0.91 × 104 (95% CI: 0.50 × 104-1.33 × 104) (76.16%) for long- and short-term exposure, respectively. The number of avoidable deaths attributed to PM2.5 reduction is larger than the level of premature deaths related to increasing O3. Although annual mean PM2.5 concentrations have fallen rapidly, the benefits of reducing long-term exposure are limited, whereas the deaths associated with acute exposure decrease more significantly due to the reduction of heavy-pollution days by implementing emergency measures. The results show appreciable effectiveness in protecting human health and illustrate that synchronous control of PM2.5 and O3 pollution should be emphasized.	CI	 confidence interval

Heat stress impairs oocyte maturation through ceramide-mediated apoptosis in pigs.	33288257	Heat stress (HS) is an emerging issue that greatly impairs the reproductive performance of animals and humans. In particular, disruption of oocyte maturation due to HS is considered a major cause of impaired reproductive performance. HS is known to induce ceramide generation, which causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated whether inhibition of ceramide generation ameliorates HS-induced apoptosis in porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) using specific inhibitors of the de novo (fumonisin B1, FB1) and hydrolytic pathways (desipramine, Des) of ceramide formation. We investigated the effects of FB1 and Des supplementation under HS conditions (41.5 °C for 44 h) on in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine COCs. After IVM, HS significantly reduced proportion of COCs exhibiting fully expanded cumulus cells and the rate of metaphase II in oocytes. After parthenogenetic activation (PA), HS significantly reduced the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation with a lower total cell number and a higher percentage of apoptosis in blastocysts. However, FB1 or Des supplementation under HS avoided detrimental effects of HS on expansion of cumulus cells, nuclear maturation of oocytes, and embryonic development after PA including the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation, total cell number, and the percentage of apoptosis in blastocysts. Furthermore, FB1 or Des addition under HS, compared with HS alone, significantly decreased ceramide generation, ROS production, cytochrome C expression, and apoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in COCs, reaching levels comparable with those of the control. Taken together, our results indicate that HS impaired oocyte maturation through ceramide-mediated apoptosis.	PA	 parthenogenetic activation

In particular, disruption of oocyte maturation due to HS is considered a major cause of impaired reproductive performance. HS is known to induce ceramide generation, which causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated whether inhibition of ceramide generation ameliorates HS-induced apoptosis in porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) using specific inhibitors of the de novo (fumonisin B1, FB1) and hydrolytic pathways (desipramine, Des) of ceramide formation. We investigated the effects of FB1 and Des supplementation under HS conditions (41.5 °C for 44 h) on in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine COCs. After IVM, HS significantly reduced proportion of COCs exhibiting fully expanded cumulus cells and the rate of metaphase II in oocytes. After parthenogenetic activation (PA), HS significantly reduced the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation with a lower total cell number and a higher percentage of apoptosis in blastocysts. However, FB1 or Des supplementation under HS avoided detrimental effects of HS on expansion of cumulus cells, nuclear maturation of oocytes, and embryonic development after PA including the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation, total cell number, and the percentage of apoptosis in blastocysts. Furthermore, FB1 or Des addition under HS, compared with HS alone, significantly decreased ceramide generation, ROS production, cytochrome C expression, and apoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in COCs, reaching levels comparable with those of the control. Taken together, our results indicate that HS impaired oocyte maturation through ceramide-mediated apoptosis.	HS	 Heat stress
Assessing the potential of waste activated sludge and food waste co-fermentation for carboxylic acids production.	33288258	This study investigated waste activated sludge (WAS) and food waste (FW) co-fermentation in batch assays to produce carboxylic acids. Three mixtures (50%, 70% and 90% WAS in VS basis) were studied under different conditions: with and without extra alkalinity, and with and without WAS auto-hydrolysis pre-treatment. All tests were carried out at 35 °C, without pH adjustment and without external inoculum. Experimental results showed that co-fermentation yields, including volatile fatty acids and lactic acid, were always higher than WAS and FW mono-fermentation yields (ca. 100 and 80 mgCOD/gVS, respectively). Co-fermentation yields increased as the proportion of FW in the mixture increased, indicating that the improvement was primarily due to a higher FW degradation under co-fermentation conditions. The maximum co-fermentation yield was on average 480 mgCOD/gVS for the WAS/FW_50/50 mixture. The importance of pH on co-fermentation performance was evident in the experiments carried out with extra alkalinity, which showed that the proportion of WAS in the mixture should be high enough to keep the pH above 5.0. However, fermenters operational conditions should also prevent the enrichment of acetic acid consuming microorganisms. WAS auto-hydrolysis pre-treatment did not enhance co-fermentation yields but showed minor kinetic improvements. Regarding the product profile, butyric acid was enriched as the proportion of FW in the mixture increased and the concomitant pH decreased to the detriment of propionic acid. Propionic acid prevailed under neutral pH in the WAS mono-fermentation and the WAS/FW_90/10 mixture.	WAS)	 waste activated sludge
Summertime atmospheric dicarboxylic acids and related SOA in the background region of Yangtze River Delta, China: Implications for heterogeneous reaction of oxalic acid with sea salts.	33288259	The diacid chemistry of summertime PM2.5 and the size-segregated aerosols (9-stages) in Chongming Island, a coastal site in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, were investigated. Our results showed that oxalic acid (C2) was the dominant dicarboxylic acid, followed by succinic acid (C4), malonic acid (C3), adipic acid (C6) and phthalic acid (Ph). Two types of haze pollution events were identified during the sampling period, i.e., Event I, which was mainly caused by the local biomass burning emission, and Event II, which was caused by a long-distance transport of the YRD urban pollution. C2 linearly correlated with SO42- and NO3- in Event I but only with O3 in Event II, indicating that oxalic acid formation was dominated by the aerosol aqueous phase oxidation in Event I and by the gaseous phase oxidation in Event II, respectively. 65.5% of Cl- in sea salts at the site in the clean period was depleted and robustly correlated with oxalic acid (R2 = 0.74). We proposed a mechanism to explain such a significant Cl- depletion, in which anthropogenic VOC oxidize into oxalic acid and its precursors such as glyoxal and methyglyoxal by a photochemical oxidation, and then oxalic acid and the related compounds subsequently react with sea salts and release HCl into the troposphere. The significant Cl- depletion of sea salts related with the organic acid (C2) in coastal China was found for the first time and should be considered in future studies, because oxalic acid and related SOA in the country are abundant and the released HCl may effectively enhance the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere by photolytically producing Cl radicals.

Association of low blood arsenic exposure with level of malondialdehyde among Chinese adults aged 65 and older.	33288260	High environmental arsenic exposure can increase chronic oxidative stress in experimental studies and in occupational epidemiology studies. Many regulatory agencies have put forth arsenic exposure limits, it is still unclear that whether low environmental arsenic exposure was associated with adverse health outcome in general population. This study aimed to explore the association of low blood arsenic with malondialdehyde in community-dwelling older adults. We used a cross-sectional study of 2384 older adult individuals aged ≥65 years (mean age: 85 years) from the Healthy Aging and Biomarkers Cohort Study in 2017. The median blood arsenic level was 1.41 μg/L. High oxidative stress was categorized according to the 95th percentile of MDA levels (7.47 nmol/mL). Restricted cubic spline models showed that blood arsenic levels were positively associated with malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.01); and the risk of high oxidative stress was no longer significantly increased when blood arsenic level up to 8.74 μg/L. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratios of high oxidative stress for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of blood arsenic were 2.35 (1.11-4.96), 3.87 (1.90-7.91), and 4.18 (2.00-8.72) (Ptrend < 0.01), compared with the first quartile. We concluded that even low arsenic exposure was associated with higher risk of oxidative stress, in a nonlinear dose-response.	ĠMDA	 malondialdehyde
Stable isotope signatures reveal the significant contributions of microphytobenthos and saltmarsh-driven nutrition in the intertidal benthic food webs.	33288261	A tidal saltmarsh supporting marine ecosystem services becomes more recognized, but an understanding of its trophic dynamics is far limited. We investigated the benthic food-web dynamics in Ganghwa tidal flat, a representative tidal saltmarsh of South Korea. The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio values were analyzed for the sixteen species of macrobenthos and their potential food sources such as microphytobenthos (MPB) and various organic matters. A year-round survey was conducted in the three sites at Ganghwa showing the different types of sediment bottom (sandy mud or mud) and/or vegetation (Phragmites or Suaeda). In general, the isotopic signature fairly well demonstrated that trophic structure is primarily influenced by sediment mud content and/or dominated vegetation. Among the four feeding types of consumers (filter feeder; deposit feeder; omnivore; carnivore), the deposit feeders such as mollusk, arthropod, and annelid showed increased dietary dependency on MPB at bare sites. Whilst they actively utilized 13C-depleted organic matters at vegetated sites. Meantime, significantly enriched stable nitrogen isotopic ratio of macrobenthos was evidenced in fall, which reflected the seasonal variation of food sources and physiological processes in survival strategy. Overall, the stable isotopic approach was useful to address the key factors (in)directly influencing the benthic food web structure and its functioning in a typical tidal saltmarsh of the Yellow Sea.

Integrative investigation of dust emissions by dust storms and dust devils in North Africa.	33288262	Dust aerosols in North Africa account for >50% of the global total; however dust emission areas are still unclear. Based on the analysis of dust storms simulated with the numerical Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, satellite aerosol index (AI), and the dust data observed at 300 meteorological stations over 20 years, the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of dust storm, dust devil and AI are compared and analyzed. The results show that: 1) There are two dust emission mechanisms: the dynamically-dominated dust storm and thermally-dominated dust devil; 2) Dust storms occur most frequently in Spring and are concentrated in the areas of Grand Erg Occidental Desert to the Erg Chech-Adrar Desert, the northern part of Grand Erg Oriental, the Atouila Desert to the Ouarane Desert, the Mediterranean coast, the eastern side of Nubian Desert and Bodélé Depression; 3) Dust devils occur most frequently from April to August and are mainly concentrated in the central part of North Africa, especially in the southwest of Hoggar Mountains to the west of Air Mountains, the border area of Egypt - Sudan - Libya and the vicinity of Tibesti Plateau; 4) The spatio-temporal distribution of AI is correlated more with the dust devils emission whereas the annual average contributions by dust storms and dust devils are 61.3% and 38.7%, respectively. This study discovers a new area of dust emissions by dust devils, and provides a better explanation for the spatio-temporal distribution of AI in North Africa.	AI	 aerosol index

Environmental-friendly coal gangue-biochar composites reclaiming phosphate from water as a slow-release fertilizer.	33288263	To solve the problem of limited adsorption efficiency of pristine biochar for phosphate, a novel biochar composite was prepared from different feedstocks and coal gangue by one facile-step pyrolysis method. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, adsorbent dosage, pH of the solution, and coexisting ions on phosphate adsorption were analyzed. The adsorption performance and mechanism of phosphate in water were investigated. The application of the phosphorus-laden (P-laden) composite as slow-release fertilizer was evaluated by a germination test. The results showed that the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of coal gangue modified oilseed rape straw biochar prepared at 700 °C (CG-OR700) was 7.9 mg/g at pH 4.0, which is 4.6 times that of pristine biochar. The adsorption process can be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm adsorption model. The mechanism of phosphate adsorption mainly includes surface precipitation, ligand exchange, and electrostatic attraction. The P-laden biochar can be used as a slow-release fertilizer to promote seed germination and growth. This study shows that the coal gangue modified biochar composite can not only be used to remove phosphate from wastewater, but also be used as a slow-release fertilizer, providing a new way for the phosphorus recovery and resource utilization of solid wastes.

Recovery from air pollution and subsequent acidification masks the effects of climate change on a freshwater macroinvertebrate community.	33288265	Freshwater ecosystems are dynamic, complex systems with a multitude of physical and ecological processes and stressors which drive fluctuations on the community-level. Disentangling the effects of different processes and stressors is challenging due to their interconnected nature. However, as protected areas (i.e. national parks) are less anthropogenically impacted, they are ideal for investigating single stressors. We focus on the Bavarian Forest National Park, a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Germany, where the major stressors are climate warming, air pollution (i.e. acidification) and bark beetle infestations. We investigated the effects of these stressors on freshwater macroinvertebrates using comprehensive long-term (1983-2014) datasets comprising high-resolution macroinvertebrate and physico-chemical data from a near-natural stream. Macroinvertebrate communities have undergone substantial changes over the past 32 years, highlighted by increases in overall community abundance (+173%) and richness (+51.6%) as well as taxonomic restructuring driven by a disproportional increase of dipterans. Prior to the year 2000, regression analyses revealed a decline in sulphate deposition and subsequent recovery from historical acidification as potential drivers of the increases in abundance and richness rather than to increases in water temperature (1.5 °C overall increase). Post 2000, however, alterations to nutrient cycling caused by bark beetle infestations coupled with warming temperatures were correlated to taxonomic restructuring and disproportional increases of dipterans at the expense of sensitive taxa such as plecopterans and trichopterans. Our results highlight the challenges when investigating the effects of climate change within a multi-stressor context. Even in conservation areas, recovery from previous disturbance might mask the effects of ongoing disturbances like climate change. Overall, we observed strong community restructuring, demonstrating that stenothermal headwater communities face additional stress due to emerging competition with tolerant taxa. Conservation efforts should consider the temporal variability of communities and their recovery from disturbances to adequately identify species vulnerable to local or widespread extinction.

Complex causes of landslides after ice sheet retreat: Post-LGM mass movements in the Northern Patagonian Icefield region.	33288266	Although the dynamics of individual rock-slope failures above recently shrinking glaciers have received increasing study, less is known about the spatial distribution of landslides in paraglacial settings. Here, we present a landslide inventory for large deglaciated area (~100,000 km2) situated within the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) limits of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI). Using satellite images and the TanDEM-X digital elevation model, we mapped a total of 15,543 landslides, among which 1006 are deep-seated landslides (DSLs) with area ≥0.01 km2. The distribution of DSLs is highly asymmetric in a W-E transect of the NPI region, with pronounced clustering along the semi-arid eastern front of the Patagonian Andes. The most strongly affected domain is volcanic tablelands overlying weak Miocene sedimentary rocks, but DSLs tend to also cluster along recently deglaciated (i.e. since the end of the 19th century) eastern margin of the NPI. Compared with other high mountain regions, alpine valleys of the Patagonian Andes are affected by DSLs only in <1% of their area, an order of magnitude lower than in other reported deglaciated mountains. The modest incidence of DSLs in the Patagonian Andes is due to dominance of hard granitoid rocks and relatively weak historical seismic activity. We conclude that 1) geological conditions control the distribution of DSLs and their types in the NPI region; 2) paraglacial effects play secondary (although locally important) roles in the origin of DSLs; 3) local clusters of large DSLs originate due to specifics of the post-LGM landscape evolution, involving drawdowns of glacial lakes and incision of rivers into the unconsolidated deposits; and 4) increased abundance of landslides above the recently shrinking margin of the NPI results from the repeated Holocene fluctuations of glacier snouts around the Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier limits and the spatial coincidence of glacial debuttressing effects with the presence of active faults.

Elucidating the effect of HONO on O3 pollution by a case study in southwest China.	33288267	Photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) is one of the major sources for atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH), playing significant role in initiating tropospheric photochemical reactions for ozone (O3) production. However, scarce field investigations were conducted to elucidate this effect. In this study, a field campaign was conducted at a suburban site in southwest China. The whole observation was classified into three periods based on O3 levels and data coverage: the serious O3 pollution period (Aug 13-18 as P1), the O3 pollution period (Aug 22-28 as P2) and the clean period (Sep 3-12 as P3), with average O3 peak values of 96 ppb, 82 ppb and 44 ppb, respectively. There was no significant difference of the levels of O3 precursors (VOCs and NOx) between P1 and P2, and thus the evident elevation of OH peak values in P1 was suspected to be the most possible explanation for the higher O3 peak values. Considering the larger contribution of HONO photolysis to HOX primary production than photolysis of HCHO, O3 and ozonolysis of Alkenes, sensitivity tests of HONO reduction on O3 production rate in P1 are conducted by a 0-dimension model. Reduced HONO concentration effectively slows the O3 production in the morning, and such effect correlates with the calculated production rate of OH radicals from HONO photolysis. Higher HONO level supplying for OH radical initiation in the early morning might be the main reason for the higher O3 peak values in P1, which explained the correlation (R2 = 0.51) between average O3 value during daytime (10:00-19:00 LT) and average HONO value during early morning (00:00-05:00 LT). For nighttime accumulation, a suitable range of relative humidity that favored NO2 conversion within P1 was assumed to be the reason for the higher HONO concentration in the following early morning which promoted O3 peak values.

Mussels get higher: A study on the occurrence of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in seawater, sediment and mussels from a subtropical ecosystem (Santos Bay, Brazil).	33288268	Data on the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) in marine environmental compartments are still limited, with few studies reporting superficial water contamination, mainly in tropical zones. In this sense, environmental data of these substances are essential to identify potential polluting sources, as well as their impact in costal ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of COC and BE in seawater, sediment and mussels from a subtropical coastal zone (Santos Bay, São Paulo, Brazil), as well as to determine a field measured Bioaccumulation Factor (BAF). COC and BE were detected in all water samples in concentrations ranging from 1.91 ng·L-1 to 12.52 ng·L-1 and 9.88 ng·L-1 to 28.53 ng·L-1, respectively. In sediments, only COC was quantified in concentrations ranging from 0.94 ng·g-1 to 46.85 ng·g-1. Similarly, only COC was detected in tissues of mussels 0.914 μg·kg-1 to 4.58 μg·kg-1 (ww). The field-measured BAF ranged from 163 to 1454 (L·kg-1). Our results pointed out a widespread contamination by cocaine and its main human metabolite benzoylecgonine in Santos Bay. Mussels were able to accumulate COC in areas used by residents and tourists for bathing, fishing, and harvest, denoting concern to human health. Therefore, our data can be considered a preliminary assessment, which indicates the need to evaluate drugs (including illicit as COC) in environmental and seafood monitoring programs, in order to understand their risks on the ecosystem and human health.

The field-measured BAF ranged from 163 to 1454 (L·kg-1). Our results pointed out a widespread contamination by cocaine and its main human metabolite benzoylecgonine in Santos Bay. Mussels were able to accumulate COC in areas used by residents and tourists for bathing, fishing, and harvest, denoting concern to human health. Therefore, our data can be considered a preliminary assessment, which indicates the need to evaluate drugs (including illicit as COC) in environmental and seafood monitoring programs, in order to understand their risks on the ecosystem and human health.

Coordinated effects of air pollution control devices on PAH emissions in coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers.	33288269	Coal-fired power plants are important sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions in the world. The effects of various air pollution control devices (APCDs) on PAH emissions were investigated by analyzing samples from inlets and outlets of APCDs in six coal-fired power plants (A-F) and two coal-fired industrial boilers (G and H). The APCDs were electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), wet flue gas desulfurization systems (WFGDs), and wet ESPs (WESPs). The PAH congener patterns for the coal-fired plants were similar. Gas-phase PAHs were dominant in flue gases, and the most abundant PAH was naphthalene. Three- and four-ring PAHs were dominant in fly ash. Positive correlations were found between the PAH and total organic carbon contents of fly ash (R2 0.87) and slag (R2 0.92). Plants D-F, equipped with low-low-temperature ESPs (LLT-ESPs) and WESPs discharged the lowest PAHs. Circulating water was an important source of PAHs in the desulfurization except in plant A, which used desalinated seawater rather than circulating water in the desulfurization process. WESPs decreased PAH concentrations by an average of 20.67%, which can be spread to other plants to reduce PAHs.	WFGDs	 wet flue gas desulfurization systems

Using a multi-disciplinary approach to characterize groundwater systems in arid and semi-arid environments: The case of Biskra and Batna regions (NE Algeria).	33288271	This study presents a multi-disciplinary approach for the hydrogeological assessment and characterization of water resources in typical arid and semi-arid areas with high anthropogenic pressure, and where environmental conditions and political context prevent extensive field surveys. The use of a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogeological conceptual model, integrating hydrochemical and multi-isotope data, is proposed for the Batna and Biskra area (NE Algeria). Geological data were assembled in 3D geological software, from which a 3D hydrogeological conceptual model was constructed, which included the delineation of groundwater flow directions. The isotopic characterization, including deuterium and oxygen isotopic composition of water (δ2H and δ18O), and tritium (3H), provided information regarding recharge sources, flow pathways and residence times of groundwaters. Hydrochemical parameters, measured on the same samples, supported the interpretation of isotope data. All data were processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. The effectiveness of this approach was tested on a complex system of aquifers with high hydrogeological heterogeneity. Results show the important role the tectonic setting of an area can play in the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of its principal groundwater systems. The fault network in the study region connects different aquifers, resulting in the mixing of groundwaters. The region most influenced by geological structures is the southern part of the study area, close to Biskra city. In fact, besides a limited contribution of recharge from rain and surface water derived from flood events, the recharge of the Cenozoic aquifers seems to proceed from the ascension of deeper Cretaceous groundwaters through the fault network, as indicated by temperature, bulk chemistry and in particular δ2H, δ18O and 3H results. In contrast, results suggest that the recharge of the low mineralized Maastrichtian waters is primarily influenced by local precipitation and runoff in the mountainous northern part of the study area. Tritium content, low salinity, and bulk chemistry all suggest such waters to be a mix of pre-bomb (deeper flow-lines within the aquifer) and recent water, with no contribution from the deepest Continental Intercalaire groundwaters. The proposed approach reduces ambiguity about the studied aquifer systems, greatly improves the conceptual understanding of their behaviour, and could provide insights into the vulnerability of the aquifers to different anthropogenic pollution phenomena. The methodology used appears to be a valid tool that could be applied to other geographical areas, to inform the design and implementation of efficient management strategies aimed at improving the quality and availability of water resources. Moreover, three-dimensional modelling methods are becoming increasingly applied to different aspects of groundwater management, to obtain a detailed picture of subsurface conditions.

Similar toxicity mechanisms between graphene oxide and oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes in Microcystis aeruginosa.	33288276	In photosynthetic microorganisms, the toxicity of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) is typically characterized by a decrease in growth, viability, photosynthesis, as well as the induction of oxidative stress. However, it is currently unclear how the shape of the carbon structure in CNMs, such as in the 1-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) compared to the two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO), affects the way they interact with cells. In this study, the effects of GO and oxidized multi-walled CNTs were compared in the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa to determine the similarities or differences in how the two CNMs interact with and induce toxicity to cyanobacteria. Using change in Chlorophyll a concentrations, the effective concentrations inducing 50% inhibition (EC50) at 96 h are found to be 11.1 μg/mL and 7.38 μg/mL for GO and CNTs, respectively. The EC50 of the two CNMs were not found to be statistically different. Changes in fluorescein diacetate and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence, measured at the EC50 concentrations, suggest a decrease in esterase enzyme activity but no oxidative stress. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy imaging did not show extensive membrane damage in cells exposed to GO or CNTs. Altogether, the decrease in metabolic activity and photosynthetic activity without oxidative stress or membrane damage support the hypothesis that both GO and CNTs induced indirect toxicity through physical mechanisms associated with light shading and cell aggregation. This indirect toxicity explains why the intrinsic differences in shape, size, and surface properties between CNTs and GO did not result in differences in how they induce toxicity to cyanobacteria.

Proteomic insight on the polychlorinated biphenyl degrading mechanism of Pleurotus pulmonarius LBM 105.	33288277	White-rot fungi are well known bioremediation agents capable of removing recalcitrant xenobiotics. However, the molecular mechanism involved in this process is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to compare the proteomic profiles of Pleurotus pulmonarius LBM 105 in presence and absence of a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls. Cultures of the fungus were spiked with a mixture of Aroclors and cultivated for 28 days. This strain achieved a peak of PCBs-removal of 65.50 ± 8.09% after 21 days. The ecotoxicological assays showed a toxicity reduction of 46.47%. Based on these findings, a proteomic study was carried out and it was proven that the oxidative metabolism was highly affected. Two proteins that have a function at the transcriptional level and related to the oxidative metabolism, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the basal transcription factor 3, presented an increase in their quantity in PCBs presence. Several oxidases and reductases were highly induced, presenting the short chain reductases, aldo/keto reductases, laccases and versatile peroxidases as the enzymes with the most notorious changes. These results indicate a complex response of the fungal metabolism towards these pollutants, which includes a transcriptional response to the oxidative stress and a modification of the intra- and extra-cellular enzymatic profile.

Transformation of bromophenols by aqueous chlorination and exploration of main reaction mechanisms.	33288278	Bromophenols (BPs) are ubiquitous phenolic contaminants and typical halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are commonly detected in aquatic environments. The transformation of 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP) during chlorination process was fully explored in this research. It was found that active chlorine can react with 2,4-DBP effectively in a wide pH range of 5.0-11.0, with an apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) varying from 0.8 M-1 s-1 to 110.3 M-1 s-1. The addition of 5 mM ammonium ions almost completely suppressed the reaction via competitive consumption of free chlorine. With the concentration of HA increasing from 1.0 to 10.0 mg L-1, the inhibition on the degradation of 2,4-DBP increased from 8.7% to 63.4%. By contrast, bromide ions at a concentration of 5 mM accelerated the process by about 4 times, due to the formation of hypobromous acid. On the basis of the eleven products (with eight nominal masses) identified by LC-TOF-MS, electrophilic substitution reactions and single-electron transfer reactions were mainly involved in the chlorination process. The concentration of primary chlorine-substituted products was about 4 times that of the dimer products, demonstrating that electrophilic substitution reaction was predominant during chlorination of 2,4-DBP. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations revealed that HOCl is the dominant active oxidizing species for elimination of 2,4-DBP and coupling reaction occurs more easily at para and ortho position of hydroxyl group in the phenolic moiety. These findings could provide some new insights into the environmental fate of bromophenols during chlorine disinfection of water and wastewaters.	DFT	 Density functional theory

The occurrence of bisphenol compounds in animal feed plastic packaging and migration into feed.	33288279	Animal-derived food plays an important role in human exposure to bisphenol compounds (BPs), potentially as a result of the presence of BPs in animal feed. Even so, there have been few studies regarding the source of BPs in animal feed. The objective of the present study was to assess both the occurrence of BPs in animal feed packaging and the migration of BPs from feed packaging into animal feed. Thirteen BPs were monitored in 30 used animal feed plastic packaging samples previously employed for different animal feedstuffs and made of polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE). Six and two BPs were found in PP-based woven bags and PE-based films, respectively. Bisphenol A (BPA) was the predominant analogue with a wide range of concentrations in both the PP- and PE-based packaging. A migration experiment was performed and provided the first-ever confirmation that BPA is able to migrate from plastic packaging into solid feed. Both contact time and the initial BP concentration affected the extent of migration. These results expand our knowledge regarding the origin of BPs in the food chain and suggest that further study of the bioaccumulation of BPs in animals is warranted.	BPA	 Bisphenol A

Hexabromocyclododecane alters malachite green and lead(II) adsorption behaviors onto polystyrene microplastics: Interaction mechanism and competitive effect.	33288280	The role of microplastics (MPs) as a carrier of pollutants in water environment is an emerging issue; however, information regarding the underlying mechanisms for malachite green (MG) and Pb(II) adsorption onto hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)-polystyrene (PS) composites MPs (HBCD-PS MPs) is still lacking. In this study, the adsorption behaviors and mechanisms of MG and Pb(II) onto PS and HBCD-PS MPs were investigated in batch adsorption experiments. The amounts of MG and Pb(II) adsorbed onto PS MPs were negligible while the presence of HBCD significantly enhanced the adsorption of MG and Pb(II) onto HBCD-PS MPs. The results of intra-particle and film diffusion model confirmed that the adsorption of MG and Pb(II) onto HBCD-PS MPs was dominated by intra-particle diffusion. The maximum adsorption amount (qm) of Pb(II) and MG onto HBCD-PS MPs followed the sequence of Pb(II) (3.33 μmol g-1) > MG (1.87 μmol g-1). In binary systems, MG and Pb(II) showed competitive adsorption onto HBCD-PS MPs, and Pb(II) exhibited relatively higher affinity to be adsorbed onto HBCD-PS MPs. Solution pH and salinity played a crucial role in the adsorption process. XPS analysis suggested that the -Br participated in the adsorption process as an electron-withdrawing group. Overall, electrostatic interaction regulated the adsorption of MG and Pb(II) onto HBCD-PS MPs. Results from this study demonstrated that HBCD could enhance the role of MPs in the MG and Pb(II) migration by changing their adsorption behavior onto MPs.	HBCD)-polystyrenePS	 hexabromocyclododecane
Hexabromocyclododecane alters malachite green and lead(II) adsorption behaviors onto polystyrene microplastics: Interaction mechanism and competitive effect.	33288280	The role of microplastics (MPs) as a carrier of pollutants in water environment is an emerging issue; however, information regarding the underlying mechanisms for malachite green (MG) and Pb(II) adsorption onto hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)-polystyrene (PS) composites MPs (HBCD-PS MPs) is still lacking. In this study, the adsorption behaviors and mechanisms of MG and Pb(II) onto PS and HBCD-PS MPs were investigated in batch adsorption experiments.

Selective beta-cell toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on isolated pancreatic islets.	33288281	An association between exposure to environmental pollutants and diabetes risk has been repeatedly shown by epidemiological studies. However, the biological basis of this association still need to be clarified. In this research we explored the effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure on isolated pancreatic islets. After 1, 6 and 24 h exposure of isolated islets to different concentrations (1-50 nM) of TCDD we assayed: i) cell survival; ii) ultrastructure; iii) glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS); iv) expression of selected genes. A significant, dose-related increase of both necrosis and apoptosis was observed isolated rat islets after 24 h exposure to TCDD. The electron microscopic analysis revealed, at the same time point, the presence of several ultrastructural alterations (mitochondrial swelling, increased mitophagy, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum) that, very interestingly, were exclusively observed in beta cells and not in other endocrine cells. Similar results were obtained in isolated human islets. GSIS was rapidly (1 h) and persistently (6 and 24 h) decreased by TCDD exposure even at the smallest concentration (1 nM). TCDD exposure significantly affected gene expression in isolated islets: Glut2, Gck, Bcl-xL, MafA, Pdx1 FoxO1 and IRE1 gene expression was significantly decreased, whereas Puma, DP5, iNOS and Chop gene expression was significantly increased after 6 h exposure to TCDD. In conclusion, our results clearly indicated that pancreatic beta cells represent not only a sensitive but also a specific target of the toxic action of dioxin.

Microbial influenced corrosion of processing industry by re-circulating waste water and its control measures - A review.	33288282	In this review article, illustrating the impact and fundamental stuff of microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) along with mechanism, maintenance of materials, human life, wellbeing and inhibitors for cooling towers. Corrosion is a natural mechanism of oxidation and reduction of metal ions by chemical and electrochemical processes and microorganism accumulation. MIC occurs through the aggregation of microbes which can be secreting the extra polymeric substances (EPS) that oxidation of the metal surface. According to the reviews, in the cooling water system, the corrosion begins in the anode charge because its oxidation reaction quickly takes place on the metal surface than the cathode charge. Annihilate the corrosion process needs certain helper substances such as chemical or green compounds, called inhibitors. Corrosion inhibitors typically adopt the adsorption mechanism due to the presence of organic hetero atoms. Chemical and green inhibitors are used to prevent corrosion processes and since ancient times, vast quantities of chemical inhibitors have been used in industry due to their effectiveness and consistency. But still, the chemical inhibitors are more toxic to humans and the environment. Instead of chemical inhibitors, green inhibitors (natural products like plant leaves, flowers, stem, buds, roots and sea algae) are developed and used in industries. Generally, green inhibitors contain natural compounds, high inhibition efficiency, economic, eco- and human-friendly, and strong potential features against corrosion. Thus, a lot of research is ongoing to discover the green inhibitors in various parts of plants and seaweeds.	EPS	 extra polymeric substances

Graphene oxide nanoparticles and hematite colloids behave oppositely in their co-transport in saturated porous media.	33288283	Since iron oxide minerals are ubiquitous in natural environments, the release of graphene oxide (GO) into environmental ecosystems can potentially interact with iron oxide particles and thus alter their surface properties, resulting in the change of their transport behaviors in subsurface systems. Column experiments were performed in this study to investigate the co-transport of GO nanoparticles and hematite colloids (a model representative of iron oxides) in saturated sand. The results demonstrated that the presence of hematite inhibited GO transport in quartz sand columns due to the formation of less negatively charged GO-hematite heteroaggregates and additional deposition sites provided by the adsorbed hematite on sand surfaces. Contrarily, GO co-present in suspensions significantly enhanced the transport of hematite colloids through different mechanisms such as the increase of electrostatic repulsion, decreased physical straining, GO-facilitated transport of hematite (i.e., highly mobile GO nanoparticles served as a mobile carrier for hematite). We also found that the co-transport behaviors of GO and hematite depended on solution chemistry (e.g., pH, ionic strength, and divalent cation (i.e., Ca2+)), which affected the electrostatic interaction as well as heteroaggregation behaviors between GO nanoparticles and hematite colloids. The findings provide an insight into the potential fate of carbon nanomaterials affected by mineral colloids existing in natural waters and soils.	GO	 graphene oxide
Acute neurotoxicity evaluation of two anticholinesterasic insecticides, independently and in mixtures, and a neonicotinoid on a freshwater gastropod.	33288284	Neurotoxic insecticides are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, frequently as part of complex mixtures. Freshwater gastropods are generally underrepresented in neurotoxicity evaluations and cumulative toxicity testing. This study investigates the behavioural and biochemical effects of acute exposures to the carbamate carbaryl, the organophosphate chlorpyrifos, and the neonicotinoid acetamiprid on the freshwater gastropod Chilina gibbosa. First, we evaluated behavioural neurotoxicity and cholinesterase (ChE), carboxylesterase (CE), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities in acute (48h) single-chemical exposures to increasing concentrations of carbaryl (0.5-500 μg L-1), chlorpyrifos (10-7500 μg L-1), and acetamiprid (1-10000 μg L-1). We then studied the effects of acute (48h) exposures to binary mixtures of carbaryl and chlorpyrifos equivalent to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 ChE 48h-IC50. None of the insecticides caused severe behavioural neurotoxicity, except for a significant lack of adherence by 5000 μg L-1 chlorpyrifos. Carbaryl caused concentration-dependent inhibition of ChEs (NOEC 5 μg L-1; 48h-IC50 45 μg L-1) and CEs with p-nitrophenyl butyrate as substrate (NOEC 5 μg L-1; 48h-IC50 37 μg L-1). Chlorpyrifos caused concentration-dependent inhibition of ChEs (NOEC 50 μg L-1; 48h-IC50 946 μg L-1) but did not affect CEs (NOEC ≥7500 μg L-1). Carbaryl-chlorpyrifos mixtures inhibited ChEs additively, inhibited CEs with p-nitrophenyl butyrate, and did not affect behaviour. GST activity was not affected by single or mixture exposures. Acute exposure to acetamiprid did not affect any of the endpoints evaluated. This study provides new information on carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and acetamiprid toxicity on C. gibbosa, relevant to improve gastropod representation in ecotoxicological risk assessment.

Uptake study in Juncus sp. and Salicornia europaea of six pharmaceuticals by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.	33288285	In this work, eight plants of Juncus sp. and ten of Salicornia europaea were used for an uptake assay of pharmaceuticals (flumequine, cirpofloxacin, enrofloxacin, carbamazepine, diclofenac and ibuprofen) by irrigation at three concentration levels: 10 ng mL-1 (low level); 700 ng mL-1 (medium level) and 10 μg mL-1 (high level). Two plants irrigated with pharmaceutical-free water were set up as controls. For each level, two plants were watered every day with 50 mL (Juncus sp.) and every two days with 20 mL (Salicornia europaea) of aqueous solutions containing all the analytes at the described concentrations. Plants irrigated at 10 μg mL-1 were significantly the most affected, whereas the rest of the plants remained, in general, largely displayed no apparent physiological effects throughout the 30 days (Juncus sp.) and 21 days (Salicornia europaea) assays. Leaves and stems were cut every seven days and roots were collected at the end of the assay. The samples were lyophilized, submitted to a microwave assisted extraction using 5 mL of acetonitrile:water mixture (1:1, v/v) and they were analyzed (in triplicate) in a liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry instrument. Most of the analytes were quantified in many of the samples corresponding to the three exposure levels with the highest concentrations obtained at high exposure levels. Ibuprofen was not detected in any sample and enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and diclofenac were not detected in the samples from Salicornia europaea.	1:1Ġv/v	 acetonitrile:water mixture
Toxicity of selected airborne nitrophenols on eukaryotic cell membrane models.	33288286	Nitroaromatics belong to the group of toxic components of aerosol particles and atmospheric hydrometeors that enter the atmosphere through biomass burning and fuel combustion. In the present work, we report on the cytotoxic effects of a 2-, 3- and 4-nitrophenol mixture on a model eukaryotic-like cell membrane and compared it with in vitro cellular models BEAS-2B (immortalized bronchial epithelial cells) and A549 (cancerous alveolar epithelial cells). A selected model biomembrane comprised of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was studied. The electrochemical-based method, combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and phase-contrast microscopy imaging, allowed to get insights into the mechanism of cellular function disruption caused by airborne nitrophenols. The efficacy of the method is supported by the data obtained from in vitro experiments performed on cell models. The nitrophenol mixture exhibited cytotoxic effects at concentrations above 100 μg mL-1, as demonstrated by phase-contrast microscopy in real lung cell lines. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed the formation of membrane defects at a nitrophenol concentration of 200 μg mL-1. AFM imaging confirmed the model membrane disintegration and phospholipids rearrangement in the presence of nitrophenols. These observations indicate that particle-bound nitrophenols induce substantial changes in cell membranes and make them more permeable to aerosol, resulting in major cellular damage in the lungs when inhaled. The study provides initial evidence of cellular membrane damage induced by three important nitrated phenols present in the environment.	EIS	 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

Risk assessment of potentially toxic metal(loid)s in Vigna radiata L. under wastewater and freshwater irrigation.	33288287	Depending on the use and management, wastewater generation can be a severe environmental dilemma or a potential source. Proper application and management of municipal water (MW) in agriculture could be its sustainable use. Until now, there is rare data about the combined application of wastewater and freshwater in agriculture that could be considered as sustainable water management strategy. Also, plant (oxidative) stress responses to wastewater application have been rarely investigated. Here, we elucidated the influence of MW irrigation, diluted with canal water (CW) and groundwater (tap water; TW), on Vigna radiata to evaluate (i) the accumulation of potentially toxic metal(loid)s (PTMs; arsenic, copper, cadmium, iron, manganese, lead, nickel, zinc) in different plant tissues, (ii) biochemical modifications in plants, (iii) relative compartmentation of PTMs inside plant, and (iv) PTMs-induced health risk. Results revealed that the soil-plant transfer of PTMs and physiological changes in V. radiata varied depending on the irrigation water type. Noticeably, plants sequestered most of the PTM contents in roots (average 64%) and less were translocated to plant shoots. All the irrigation treatments provoked oxidative stress in V. radiata with high production of hydrogen peroxide, followed by an oxidation of membrane lipids and a decrease in chlorophyll content. The estimated cancer risk and hazard quotients values revealed a potential risk to human health (HQ: 2.2-108.8, CR: 0.0002-0.664), especially for arsenic, cadmium and lead. The integrated risk estimated from PTMs highlighted the unsuitability of all the treatments for crop irrigation. Therefore, in areas with high PTM levels in MW and freshwaters their mixed use is not an ideal management practice. Conclusively, this study helps to strictly monitor the quality of irrigation water before applying to crops and develop a suitable management and remediation strategy.

The estimated cancer risk and hazard quotients values revealed a potential risk to human health (HQ: 2.2-108.8, CR: 0.0002-0.664), especially for arsenic, cadmium and lead. The integrated risk estimated from PTMs highlighted the unsuitability of all the treatments for crop irrigation. Therefore, in areas with high PTM levels in MW and freshwaters their mixed use is not an ideal management practice. Conclusively, this study helps to strictly monitor the quality of irrigation water before applying to crops and develop a suitable management and remediation strategy.	MW	 municipal water
Preparation and electrochemical treatment application of Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu&rGO electrode in the degradation of clothianidin wastewater.	33288288	This work investigated the preparation of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode co-doped with graphene and europium and the electrochemical degradation of clothianidin in aqueous solution with Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu&rGO electrode. The physicochemical properties of different electrodes were characterized by using the scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, oxygen evolution potential and cyclic voltammetry tests. The results indicated that the Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu&rGO electrodes have a compact structure and fine grain size and have a higher oxygen evolution overpotential than Ti/Sb-SnO2-None, Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu and Ti/Sb-SnO2-rGO electrodes. Among the four electrodes, the Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu&rGO electrode showed the highest efficiency and was chosen as the experimental electrode. The main influence factors on the degradation of clothianidin, such as initial pH, electrolyte concentration, current density and initial concentration of clothianidin, were analyzed. The results showed that the removal rate of clothianidin can reach 96.44% under the optimal conditions for 120 min treatment. Moreover, a possible degradation pathway including the fracture of internal bonds of clothianidin such as the N-N bond, the C-N bond that connects nitroguanidine to the thiazole ring and mineralization was elucidated by intermediate products identified by HPLC-MS method and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). This paper introduces the Ti/Sb-SnO2-Eu&rGO electrode into an electrocatalytic degradation system and could provide basic data and technique support and guidance for the clothianidin wastewater pollution control.

Duration of specialty training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in the United Kingdom for trainees joining the OMFS specialist list between 2002 and 2019.	33288289	OMFS Specialty Training in the UK is usually 5 years and 'starts' at Specialty Training Year 3 (ST3). In 2007 a pilot of 'run-through' training started with Core Training (CT) posts linked to specialty training (ST1 posts). ST1 posts are usually 12 months but may be up to 24 months.	CT	 Core Training
Workforce intelligence: what data do we need to collect to understand trends in substantive oral and maxillofacial surgery consultant posts? A retrospective review and plan for the future.	33288290	Understanding workforce pressures within surgery is an inexact science. This paper assembles evidence regarding oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) consultant appointments in the UK and plans for prospective data collection in the future. Information about the number of OMFS specialists joining the UK specialist list was obtained from the General Medical Council and compared to a database of substantive OMFS consultant posts. OMFS consultants were asked to contribute information about their training programmes and consultant appointments (date, interview experience, and sub-specialty interest). This information was collated on Excel© and analysed using WinStat©. Data on OMFS consultant posts advertised in 'NHS Jobs' and the British Medical Journal were collected. The mean (SD) number of specialists joining the specialist list per year is 24.1 (5.2) with a median of 24 and a range of 15 - 36. The number of trainees completing training and numbers joining the OMFS specialist list are in balance at present. The median delay between OMFS specialist listing and appointment as a consultant was 72 days and mean of 169 with the 25th centile of five days, standard deviation of 239 days and maximum of 5.2 years. Of those returning data, 135 (47%) candidates were the sole interviewee and 83 (29%) had one other candidate at their successful interview. The mean application ratio for each post was 1.9 and the median number of candidates was one, mean 1.6 and maximum candidates seven. About half of the posts were filled by trainees from their regional training rotation. Prospective data collection on advertised posts, interviews held, expected retirements/new posts, combined with a route for trainees approaching CCT to highlight their availability may streamline recruitment and allow a more rapid recognition of recruitment problems.

Combined toxicity assessment of myclobutanil and thiamethoxam to zebrafish embryos employing multi-endpoints.	33288291	It is necessary to understand the interactions between different pesticides in ecotoxicology because pesticides never appear as individual compounds but rather in combinations with other compounds. In this study, we planned to explicate the combined toxic effect of myclobutanil (MYC) and thiamethoxam (THI) on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) by adopting multiple biomarkers. Results unraveled that the 96-h LC50 values of MYC to D. rerio at various life phases ranged from 5.2 to 10.3 mg L-1, which were lower than those of THI ranging from 147 to 246 mg L-1. Combinations of MYC and THI exhibited synergetic toxicity to zebrafish embryos. The activities of antioxidative enzymes (T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD) and detoxification enzyme (GST) were obviously varied in most of the MYC, THI and combined exposures compared to the control. The mRNA expressions of eight genes (Cu-sod, cas3, il-8, cxcl, erα, crh, cyp17 and dio1) involved in antioxidation, apoptosis, immunity and endocrine were obviously altered in the combined exposure of MYC and THI compared to their individual exposures. Our findings hinted the threats when YMC and THI co-existed, which would be beneficial for the risk assessments of pesticide mixtures.	THI	 thiamethoxam

Marine protected areas in Latin America and Caribbean threatened by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.	33288292	The present study is a literature-based analysis investigating occurrence and the possible consequences of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in marine protected areas (MPAs) of Latin America and Caribbean. The approach using overlapping of georeferenced MPA polygons with data compiled from peer-reviewed literature, published during the last 15 years, showed 341 records of PAH in 9 countries. PAH was reported to occur within the boundaries of 36 MPAs located in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay. According to quality guidelines, low to moderate impacts are expected in MPAs categorized in different management classes. Considering sediment samples, 13% of the records presented concentrations enough to cause occasional toxicity. Such level of risk was also seen in Ramsar sites and in Amazonian MPAs. In addition, based on concentrations reported in biota, occasional deleterious effects on organisms from Biosphere Reserves might occur. Diagnostic ratios pointed out petrogenic and pyrolytic processes as PAH predominant sources, and were mainly attributed to the proximity to ports, industries and urban areas. MPAs located in the vicinity of impact-generating areas may be under threat and require government attention and action, mainly through implementation of contamination monitoring programs.

The herbicide dinitramine affects the proliferation of murine testicular cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced calcium dysregulation.	33288293	The hazardous effects of herbicides are well known; however, their effects on the reproductive system remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of dinitramine (DN) on immature murine testicular cell lines (Leydig and Sertoli cells) mediated via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced calcium dysregulation in the cytosol and mitochondria. The results demonstrated that the viability and proliferation of DN-treated TM3 and TM4 cells decreased significantly, even in the spheroid state. DN induced the apoptosis of TM3 and TM4 cells and decreased the expression of genes related to cell cycle progression. Treatment with DN increased the cytosolic and intramitochondrial levels of calcium by activating ER stress signals. DN activated the Erk/P38/Jnk Mapk pathway and inactivated the Pi3k/Akt pathway in murine testicular cells. Co-treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) mitigated DN-induced calcium upregulation in both testicular cell lines. Although 2-APB did not antagonize the anti-proliferative effect of DN in TM3 cells, treatment with 2-APB and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid restored the proliferation of DN-treated TM4 cells.	2-APB	 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate

Heavy metal pollution, ecological risk, spatial distribution, and source identification in sediments of the Lijiang River, China.	33288295	The Lijiang River is of great ecological and environmental importance for Guilin City, which is located in the karst area of southeast China. Given its importance, a detailed evaluation of the heavy metals (HMs) in the river sediment is required. For the first time, 61 sediment samples were collected along the entire Lijiang River to determine pollution level and ecological risk posed by 10 HMs (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, Hg, and Cd). These were assessed using the geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index, and modified degree of contamination. The results showed that the mean concentrations of the majority of HMs exceeded their corresponding background values and followed the trend: midstream > downstream > upstream. Based on the spatial distributions and pollution indices of the 10 HMs, the Lijiang River was found to have a high accumulation of Cd, Hg, Zn, and Pb in the sediments. The midstream area was the most polluted with respect to Cd and Hg, and also posed a relatively higher potential ecological risk than the downstream and upstream areas. The sources of the assessed HMs were inferred based on a correlation analysis and principal component analysis, which identified both natural and anthropogenic sources. A higher pollution potential was associated with Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn in the midstream and downstream areas due to higher organic and carbonate content, urbanization, agricultural activities, and leisure activities (e.g., boating and cruises). In contrast, natural erosion and weathering processes were responsible for the HM concentrations in the upstream area. The findings of this study will help the local authorities to protect the important water resource of the Lijiang River.	HMs	 heavy metals
Distinct microplastic distributions in soils of different land-use types: A case study of Chinese farmlands.	33288296	Microplastic (MP) pollution poses a huge threat to agroecosystems, but the distribution characteristics of MPs in different types of farmland are still largely unknown. In this work, samples from six land-use types were collected from Chinese farmlands in five provinces. It was found that MP abundances were in the range of 2783-6366 items/kg in all samples. MP distribution results showed that over 80% of particles were less than 1 mm, and that MP sizes ranging between 0.02 and 0.2 mm represented the greatest proportion. The particle shape classified as fragment (with edges and angular) was the most frequent shape, with an abundance of approximately 54.05%. Polyethylene (PE) and polyamides (PA) were the most abundant polymers in cropped lands; 20.88% and 20.31%, respectively. Statistical analyses showed that lands used for plastic mulching (mulch film and greenhouse crops) had a significantly higher particle abundance, hence identifying plastic mulching as a major contributor to MP pollution in agricultural lands. Furthermore, paddy lands had a significantly higher MP abundance than wheat lands. Variation analyses of MP characteristics revealed that cereal crop farmlands (wheat, paddy land) were more likely to contain fibrous shapes and large MP particles (1-5 mm). Economically important tree lands (orchards, woodlands) were likely to contain fragment shapes and pony-size MPs (0.02-0.2 mm). Discrepancies among farmlands may depend on various reasons, such as mulching plastic application, irrigation, atmospheric fallout, etc. This study provides firsthand evidences about the characteristics of MP pollution in farmlands and explores some predominant MP sources in agroecosystems.

Continuous increases of surface ozone and associated premature mortality growth in China during 2015-2019.	33288298	Ambient ozone (O3) pollution has become a big issue in China. Recent studies have linked long- and short-term O3 exposure to several public health risks. In this study, we (1) characterize the long-term and short-term O3-attributed health metric in China from 2015 to 2019; (2) estimate the surface O3 trends; and (3) quantify the long-term and short-term health impacts (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality) in 350 urban Chinese cities. In these 5-years, the national annual average of daily maximum 8 h average (AVGDMA8) O3 concentrations and warm-season (April-September) 4th highest daily maximum 8 h average (4DMA8) O3 concentrations increased from 74.0 ± 15.5 μg/m3 (mean ± standard deviation) to 82.3 ± 12.0 μg/m3 and 167 ± 37.0 μg/m3 to 174 ± 30.0 μg/m3 respectively. During this period, the DMA8 O3 concentration increased by 1.9 ± 3.3 μg/m3/yr across China, with over 70% of the monitoring sites showing a positive upward trend and 19.4% with trends >5 μg/m3/yr. The estimated long-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributable to AVGDMA8 O3 exposure in 350 Chinese cities were 181,000 (95% CI: 91,500-352,000), 112,000 (95% CI: 38,100-214,000) and 33,800 (95% CI: 0-71,400) in 2019, showing increases of 52.5%, 52.9% and 54.6% respectively compared to 2015 levels. Similarly, short-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributed to ambient 4DMA8 O3 exposure were 156,000 (95% CI: 85,300-227,000), 73,500 (95% CI: 27,500-119,000) and 28,600 (95% CI: 14,500-42,800) in 2019, increases of 19.6%, 19.8% and 21.2% respectively compared to 2015. The results of this study are important in ascertaining the eﬀectiveness of recent emission control measures and to identify the areas that require urgent attention.	4DMA8ĠO3	 4th highest daily maximum 8Âłh

Management of Chylous Ascites After Laparoscopic Nephrectomy for Living Kidney Donor: A Case Report and Literature Review.	33288311	Kidney transplant is currently the elective treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) has substantial advantages over open nephrectomy. Chylous ascites (CA) is a rare surgical complication after the LLDN; there are few reports in the literature. We present a case report of a 58-year-old woman who started CA on the 21st day post operation. The recommended initial therapeutic approach to suspend the fat in the diet and place percutaneous drainage was not enough. It was decided to jointly introduce fasting and total parenteral nutrition with the administration of octreotide, resolving the complication completely in 15 days with no need for the patient to undergo surgery. The conservative management, during the first 4 to 8 weeks after the diagnosis is the best option. Surgery is generally recommended if conservative management fails. The prevalence of CA varied between 0% and 6.2% of LLDNs. In our experience of 87 LLDNs, we only presented 1.15% for this complication. There are 62 cases reported in the international literature. The mean presentation was 14 days after LLDN. All patients underwent conservative treatment, and only 15 patients (24%) went to surgery after the failure of conservative management. It would be highly useful, considering the disparity of the prevalence, if the bibliographic reports detail what hemostatic and sealing techniques are used in an LLDN. In this way it would be possible to identify which factor affects a complication like this one.	CA	 Chylous ascites
Management of Chylous Ascites After Laparoscopic Nephrectomy for Living Kidney Donor: A Case Report and Literature Review.	33288311	Kidney transplant is currently the elective treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) has substantial advantages over open nephrectomy. Chylous ascites (CA) is a rare surgical complication after the LLDN; there are few reports in the literature. We present a case report of a 58-year-old woman who started CA on the 21st day post operation. The recommended initial therapeutic approach to suspend the fat in the diet and place percutaneous drainage was not enough. It was decided to jointly introduce fasting and total parenteral nutrition with the administration of octreotide, resolving the complication completely in 15 days with no need for the patient to undergo surgery. The conservative management, during the first 4 to 8 weeks after the diagnosis is the best option. Surgery is generally recommended if conservative management fails.

Phosphorus recovery as struvite from digested sludge - experience from the full scale.	33288315	There is an ongoing paradigm shift; wastewater is often not considered a waste any more, but a source of valuable resources: nutrients (N: nitrogen, P: phosphorus, and K: potassium), energy and water. The recovery of phosphorus from municipal wastewater has gained a lot of attention because of limited phosphate rock reserves and associated geopolitics, and pollution of phosphate rock. At the WWTP of Leuven, Aquafin operates a full scale installation to recover phosphorus as struvite from digested sludge. This paper discusses the performance of the struvite plant, pollutants in the struvite, struvite use, and economics.	ĠWWTP	 municipal wastewater
Flood economic assessment of structural measure based on integrated flood risk management: A case study in Beijing.	33288316	Flood disasters have appeared more frequently in recent years because of climate change and urbanization, and Integrated Flood Risk Management (IFRM) has emerged as an effective method to reduce damage from these floods. This research studies IFRM methods in three aspects: flood risk identification of high-risk areas, flood risk assessment to quantify economic losses, and flood risk management to identify structural measures with the greatest engineering benefits. These methods were applied to Beijing as a case study, and the results showed that the Zuoan-Road area was a high-risk area with economic losses ranging from 0.7 million to 35.9 million euros over different return periods. There are five structural measures in Zuoan-Road area, with engineering benefits ranging from 0.97 to 1.60 over different return periods, and the one with the greatest engineering benefits had a fifty-year return period. The results of this research can be used to support urban flood risk management in Beijing.	IFRM	 Integrated Flood Risk Management
COVID-19: Does the infectious inoculum dose-response relationship contribute to understanding heterogeneity in disease severity and transmission dynamics?	33288314	"The variation in the speed and intensity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severity of the resulting COVID-19 disease are still imperfectly understood. We postulate a dose-response relationship in COVID-19, and that ""the dose of virus in the initial inoculum"" is an important missing link in understanding several incompletely explained observations in COVID-19 as a factor in transmission dynamics and severity of disease. We hypothesize that: (1) Viral dose in inoculum is related to severity of disease, (2) Severity of disease is related to transmission potential, and (3) In certain contexts, chains of severe cases can build up to severe local outbreaks, and large-scale intensive epidemics. Considerable evidence from other infectious diseases substantiates this hypothesis and recent evidence from COVID-19 points in the same direction. We suggest research avenues to validate the hypothesis. If proven, our hypothesis could strengthen the scientific basis for deciding priority containment measures in various contexts in particular the importance of avoiding super-spreading events and the benefits of mass masking."

Leachability of metals from waste incineration residues by iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria.	33288317	Hazardous waste disposal via incineration generates a substantial amount of ashes and slags which pose an environmental risk due to their toxicity. Currently, these residues are deposited in landfills with loss of potentially recyclable raw material. In this study, the use of acidophilic bioleaching bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans) as an environmentally friendly, efficient strategy for the recovery of valuable metals from incineration residues was investigated. Zinc, Cobalt, Copper, and Manganese from three different incineration residues were bio-extracted up to 100% using A. ferrooxidans under ferrous iron oxidation. The other metals showed lower leaching efficiencies based on the type of culture used. Sulfur-oxidizing cultures A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans, containing sulfur as the sole substrate, expressed a significantly lower leaching efficiency (up to 50%). According to ICP-MS, ashes and slags contained Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, and Ni in economically attractive concentrations between 0.2 and 75 mg g-1. Compared to conventional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes, our biological approach provides many advantages such as: the use of a limited amount of used strong acids (H2SO4 or HCl), recycling operations at lower temperatures (~30 °C) and no emission of toxic gases during combustion (i.e., dioxins and furans).

Assessment of POFA -Cementitious material as backfill barrier in DSRS borehole disposal: 226Ra confinement.	33288318	Disused Sealed Radioactive Sources (DSRS) borehole disposal is an innovative concept recommended by international atomic energy agency (IAEA) to improve the safety and security of the management end point for these sources. A green application of Palm Oil Fuel Ash (POFA) as a supplementary material for cementitious backfill barrier in DSRS borehole disposal facility is proposed. Samples with up to 50% POFA replacement complied with the mechanical and hydraulic performance requirements for backfill barriers in retrievable radioactive waste disposal facilities. The structures of one year old OPC and optimum OPC-POFA cement backfills were evaluated using FESEM, XRD, EDXRF, BET, and TGA and their 226 Ra confinement performances were assessed. 30% POFA replacement improved the geochemical conditions by reducing competitive Ca2+ release into the disposal environment. It enhanced 226Ra confinement performance independently on the amount of water intrusion or releases below 2% of 1 Ci source. The improved performance is attributed to the higher fraction of active sites of OPC-POFA backfill compared to that of OPC backfill. 226Ra sorption onto C-S-H is irreversible, spontaneous, endothermic, and independent on the degree of the surface filling. The provided experimental data and theoretical analysis proved the feasibility of this green use of POFA in reducing the radiological hazard of 226Ra.	POFA	 Palm Oil Fuel Ash

Celebrex derivatives: Synthesis, α-glucosidase inhibition, crystal structures and molecular docking studies.	33288319	Celebrex (1), commonly used as an anti-inflammatory drug, was functionalized (compounds 2-9) to identify new α-glucosidase inhibitors. Initially, all the synthesized derivatives were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity but none was found to be active. Subsequently a random biological screening was carried out. Interestingly many of them were found to be potent α-glucosidase inhibitors in vitro. All the structures of synthesized derivatives were deduced through 1H NMR, FAB-MS, HR-MS, FT-IR analysis. The single-crystal X-ray structures of compounds 1, and 5 further confirmed the assigned structures. Compounds exhibited a potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 92.32 ± 1.530-445.20 ± 1.04 µM) against tested standard acarbose (IC50 = 875.75 ± 2.08 µM), except compounds 2 and 4, which appeared as inactive. Among them, compound 9 (IC50 = 92.32 ± 1.530 µM) was the most potent inhibitor of α-glucosidase enzyme. Molecular docking studies revealed that compounds 6, and 9 interacted with the key amino acid residues of α-glucosidase via H-bonding, and π-π stacking interactions. α-Glucosidase is a key target for the anti-diabetic drug development, and its inhibitors are known to exert anti hyperglycemic effect and help in lowering of post-prandial blood glucose levels.	-glucosidase	 Î±

Novel artemisinin derivatives with potent anticancer activities and the anti-colorectal cancer effect by the mitochondria-mediated pathway.	33288320	Many artemisinin derivatives have good inhibitory effects on malignant tumors. In this work, a novel series of artemisinin derivatives containing piperazine and fluorine groups were designed and synthesized and their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS technologies. The in vitro cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines was evaluated. Among the derivatives, compound 12h was found to exhibit not only the best activity against HCT-116 cells (IC50 = 0.12 ± 0.05 μM), but also low toxicity against normal cell line L02 (IC50 = 12.46 ± 0.10 μM). The mechanisms study revealed that compound 12h caused the cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased intracellular ROS and Ca2+ levels, up-regulated the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein. A series of analyses confirmed that 12h can inhibit HCT-116 cells migration and induce apoptosis by a mechanism of the mitochondria-mediated pathway in the HCT-116 cell line. The present work indicates that compound 12h may merit further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer.	IC50	 cell line

Synthesis, biological evaluation and QSAR studies of new thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as antimicrobial and antifungal agents.	33288321	A series of new thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their activity against four gram-positive and four gram-negative bacterial and eight fungal species. The majority of the compounds exhibited excellent antimicrobial and antifungal activity, being more potent than the control compounds. Compound 22, bearing a m-methoxyphenyl group and an ethylenediamine side chain anchored at C-2 of the thienopyrimidinone core, is the most potent antibacterial compound with broad antimicrobial activity with MIC values in the range of 0.05-0.13 mM, being 6 to 15 fold more potent than the controls, streptomycin and ampicillin. Furthermore, compounds 14 and 15 which bear a p-chlorophenyl and m-methoxyphenyl group, respectively, and share a 2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethan-1-ol side chain showed the best antifungal activity, being 10-15 times more potent than ketoconazole or bifonazole with MIC values 0.013-0.026 and 0.027 mM, respectively. Especially in the case of compound 15 the low MIC values were accompanied by excellent MFC values ranging from 0.056 to 0.058 mM. Evaluation of toxicity in vitro on HFL-1 human embryonic primary cells and in vivo in the nematode C. elegans revealed no toxic effects for both compounds 15 and 22 tested at the MIC concentrations. Ligand-based similarity search and molecular docking predicted that the antibacterial activity of analogue 22 is related to inhibition of the topoisomerase II DNA gyrase enzyme and the antifungal activity of compound 15 to CYP51 lanosterol demethylase enzyme. R-Group analysis as a means of computational structure activity relationship tool, highlighted the compounds' crucial pharmacophore features and their impact on the antibacterial and antifungal activity. The presence of a N-methyl piperidine ring fused to the thienopyrimidinone core plays an important role in both activities.	ĠMIC	 2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethan-1-ol

Synthesis, antidiabetic activity and molecular docking study of rhodanine-substitued spirooxindole pyrrolidine derivatives as novel α-amylase inhibitors.	33288322	In a sustained search for novel α-amylase inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we report herein the synthesis of a series of nineteen novel rhodanine-fused spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3'-oxindoles]. They were obtained by one-pot three component [3 + 2] cycloaddition of stabilized azomethine ylides, generated in situ by condensation of glycine methyl ester and the cyclic ketones 1H-indole-2,3-dione (isatin), with (Z)-5-arylidine-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-ones. The highlight of this protocol is the efficient high-yield construction of structurally diverse rhodanine-fused spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3'-oxindoles] scaffolds, including four contiguous stereocenters, along with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivities. The stereochemistry of all compounds was confirmed by NMR and corroborated by an X-ray diffraction study performed on one derivative. All cycloadducts were evaluated in vitro for their α-amylase inhibitory activity and showed good α-amylase inhibition with IC50 values ranging between 1.49 ± 0.10 and 3.06 ± 0.17 µM, with respect to the control drug acarbose (IC50 = 1.56 µM). Structural activity relationships (SARs) were also established for all synthesized compounds and the binding interactions of the most active spiropyrrolidine derivatives were modelledby means of molecular insilico docking studies. The most potent compounds 5 g, 5 k, 5 s and 5 l were further screened in vivo for their hypoglycemic activity in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, showing a reduction of the blood glucose level. Therefore, these spiropyrrolidine derivatives may be considered as promising candidates for the development of new classes of antidiabetic drugs.	T2DM	 type 2 diabetes mellitus
GJB2 mutation spectrum in the Taiwanese population and genotype-phenotype comparisons in patients with hearing loss carrying GJB2 c.109G>A and c.235delC mutations.	33288323	Hearing loss, the most common sensory abnormality, is caused by the death of or damage to inner ear hair cells. Genetic mutations are the main cause of hearing loss. We used nex-generation sequencing data released by the Taiwan Biobank to investigate the GJB2 mutation spectrum in 1517 patients. We compared hearing function in Taiwanese patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) caused by the two most common GJB2 mutations c.109G>A (p.V37I) and c.235delC. We extracted DNA from the oral mucosa of patients with NSHL and performed Sanger sequencing to confirm the genotype. Of 240 patients with NSHL, we identified 25 with GJB2 c.109G>A and 9 with GJB2 c.235delC mutations, after excluding patients aged >10 years, in whom hearing loss may have been caused due to age-related degeneration. We investigated genotype-phenotype correlations in patients harboring GJB2 c.109G>A and c.235delC mutations. Furthermore, we described the GJB2 mutation spectrum in the Taiwanese population and identified the role of homozygous and heterozygous GJB2 mutations associated with hearing phenotypes in patients with NSHL. Thus, our study provides insights into the complexity of GJB2 genetics. Our data indicate that GJB2 c.109G>A heterozygotes had poorer hearing than did homozygotes. The mechanism underlying the more severe phenotype in heterozygotes and whether the phenotype is caused by GJB2 heterozygotes or compound heterozygotes warrant future investigation.

Decreased neuroplasticity in minor burn injury survivors compared to non-injured adults: A pilot study in burn injury survivors aged 45 years and older.	33288329	Neuroplasticity is the capacity of the brain to change or adapt with experience: brain changes occur with use, disuse, and injury. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used to induce neuroplasticity in the human brain. Here, we examined rTMS-induced neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex in burns survivors and controls without injury, and whether neuroplasticity is associated with functional recovery in burns survivors.	rTMS	 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
Clinical outcomes following burn injury across the continuum of chronic glycemic control.	33288330	Diabetes has been associated with poor outcomes following burn injury. There is limited data related to prediabetes in burn injury, and no studies to date have compared clinical outcomes inpatients without diabetes, with prediabetes, and with diabetes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare clinical outcomes after burn injury across the continuum of pre-injury glucose control. A propensity score weighted cohort study of adult patients admitted for initial management of burn injury was performed. Patients were categorized as no diabetes, prediabetes or diabetes based on their admission hemoglobin A1c and past medical history. The primary outcome was length of stay per percent Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burn. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay, all-cause hospital mortality, disposition at discharge, re-grafting of same site, and amputations. A total of 2450 patients were screened; 1137 patients were included for evaluation (236 diabetes, 191 prediabetes, 710 no diabetes). After inverse probability weighing to adjust for potentially confounding factors, patients in the diabetes group had longer length of stay/%TBSA burn than both the no diabetes group (ratio of geometric means (95% CI) = 1.65 (1.25, 2.18), p < 0.001) and the prediabetes group (ratio (95% CI) = 1.49 (1.10, 2.02), p = 0.01). No statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes were observed between groups other than a higher rate of amputations in the diabetes group (2.7%) compared to the no diabetes (0.7%, p = 0.047) and prediabetes (0%, p = 0.04) groups. Further studies are needed to delineate the differences across the continuum of pre-injury glucose control in order to identify mechanisms to optimize burn-related outcomes.

A non-inferiority study comparing efficacy of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics for preventing infectious complications in patients with less severe burns.	33288331	While international burn injury guidelines discourage prophylactic antibiotics on admission, current surgery guidelines focusing on antimicrobial prophylaxis place thermal injury under a general plastics procedure umbrella, and require significant evidential extrapolation. The purpose of this study was to determine if withholding systemic antibiotics in patients with <20% total body surface area (TBSA) burns without invasive wound infections and undergo wound excision is non-inferior to patients that receive preoperative antibiotics. Success was defined as lack of graft loss, bacteremia, or surgical site infection. One-thousand and eighty-three patients were screened and 100 patients undergoing 133 operations remained after exclusions. Seventy-four percent were male. Median age and %TBSA was 41 years (30, 55) and 5 (1.5, 8.3), respectively. We found no differences in demographics between patients that did and did not receive preoperative antibiotics. The success rates were 81.7% and 84.3%, respectively. There was one clinically significant bacteremia in each group. Withholding preoperative antibiotics was non-inferior with a percent difference of 2.6 (95% CI; -10.4, 15.6). Patients that did not receive antibiotics were no more likely to incur infection-related complications. In patients with <20% TBSA burns and without active wound infections, withholding preoperative systemic antibiotics will preserve unneeded antimicrobial exposure without increasing risk of infection-related complications.

Toxic metal sequential sequestration in water using new amido-aminoacid ligand as a model for the interaction with polyamidoamines.	33288336	Polyamidoamines are low cost and easily synthesized materials that may find applications in cations sequestration and water treatment. In this paper a new amido-aminoacid ligand containing methionine has been designed as a monomeric model of the corresponding polyamidoamine. The amido-aminoacid ligand has been synthesized in high yield, by reacting acrylamide and methionine via aza-Michael addition in water and mild temperature conditions. The reaction has been monitored by NMR and Raman spectroscopies and the crystal structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The coordination ability of the ligand towards Cu2+ cations in water, as well as its affinity for Ni2+ and Co2+ has been studied by potentiometric and spectrophotometric techniques. The divalent metal cations sequestration from water may occur with sequential selection by changing the pH of the solution. The copper complex with two coordinated ligands has been fully characterized in the solid state by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The results are discussed with a view to use these materials in the treatment of water contaminated by toxic transition metal ions.	ĠX-ray	 copper

Biological mediated synthesis of RGO-ZnO composites with enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity.	33288337	In this study, we reported the biological approach to synthesis of ZnO nanorod (NR) on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for photocatalytic, antibacterial activity and hydrogen production under sunlight. Bacillus subtilis played a vital role in the production of biogenic ammonia from synthetic urine and utilized for the synthesis of ZnONR on the RGO sheet. The morphological study revealed that RGO sheets displayed a tremendous role in anchoring ZnONR. XRD patterns showed the ZnO crystal phase on the RGO sheets. XPS and Raman spectra confirmed that the bio-hydrothermal method as suitable for GO converted into RGO. The transient photocurrent and I/V measurement are exhibited as an increment on the RGO-ZnONR compared to ZnONR. The RGO-ZnONR composites showed excellent performance with decolorization of MB and textile dyes and efficient control of the E. coli and S. aureus. RGO-ZnONR exhibited remarkable noted as a higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (940 μmol/h/gcat) than the ZnONR (369.5 μmol/h/g cat). As a result of photocatalytic performance to correlate with sunlight intensity was extensively studied. RGO plays an essential role in interface electron transfer from sunlight to ZnONR for enhancing •OH radical formation to cleavage of dye color substance and eradicated bacterial cells.

Applicability of TiO2(B) nanosheets@hydrochar composites for adsorption of tetracycline (TC) from contaminated water.	33288338	We test the feasibility of TiO2(B)@carbon composites as adsorbents, derived from wheat straws, for tetracycline (TC) adsorption from aqueous solutions. Hydrochar (HC), biochar (BC), and hydrochar-derived pyrolysis char (HDPC) are synthesized hydrothermally from the waste and then functionalized with TiO2(B), named as 'Composite-1', 'Composite-2', and 'Composite-3', respectively. A higher loading of TiO2(B) into the HC was also synthesized for comparison, named as 'Composite-4'. To compare their physico-chemical changes before and after surface modification, the composites are characterized using FESEM-EDS, XRD, BET, FRTEM, and FTIR. The effects of H2O2 addition on TC removal are investigated. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms of TC removal are studied, while TC adsorption mechanisms are elaborated. We found that the Composite-4 has the highest TC removal (93%) at pH 7, 1 g/L of dose, and 4 h of reaction time at 50 mg/L of TC after adding H2O2 (10 mM). The TC adsorption capacities of the Composite-1 and Composite-4 are 40.65 and 49.26 mg/g, respectively. The TC removal by the Composite-1 follows the pseudo-second order. Overall, this suggests that converting the wheat straw into HC and then functionalizing its surface with TiO2(B) as a composite has added values to the waste as an adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

National vaccine coverage trends and funding in Latin America and the Caribbean.	33288342	From 2006 to 2011 nearly 174,000 deaths were prevented in Latin America and the Caribbean through vaccination of children under five, which is widely attributed to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Despite near global adoption of EPI recommendations, vaccination coverage shows substantial variation across world regions. Causes for low immunizations within regions are multifaceted and include vaccination program costs. To date, publications regarding vaccine coverage across Latin America and the Caribbean are not readily available. This study aimed to: (1) compare vaccine coverage trends across nations within the region; and (2) assess whether national immunization program expenditures are correlated with vaccine coverage.

UHPLC-qMS spectrum-effect relationships for Rhizoma Paridis extracts.	33288343	Rhizoma Paridis (RP) with significant anti-tumor and haemostatic effects, has been used as the raw material of many Traditional Chinese preparations. However, its active ingredients are still unclear. The present study aimed to discover bioactive ingredients from RP based on spectrum-relationship and chemometric methods. Firstly, the saponins extract was prepared by phytochemical methods. Furthermore, UHPLC-QTOF-MS and UHPLC-qMS were incorporated to establish an efficient and sensitive method for obtaining the chemical profiles of RP. A total of 34 saponins were characterized in RP and 13 of them were assigned as common peaks in 25 batches of samples. After evaluation of the anti-tumor and haemostatic activities of samples, spectrum-effect relationships were investigated by the grey relational analysis (GRA), orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) and back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). These analyses showed that polyphyllin VII (P27), polyphyllin II (P30), dioscin (P31) and polyphyllin I (P33) play a role in the haemostatic effects of RP whereas polyphyllin VII (P27), dioscin (P31), polyphyllin I (P33), progenin III (P34) were assigned as candidate ingredients accounting for the anti-tumor activity of RP. The anti-tumor and haemostatic activities of these screened ingredients were subsequently verified in vitro. Collectively, the present study established the spectrum-effect relationship mode of RP and discovered the bioactive compounds of RP, which could be also used for exploration of bioactive compounds in herbal medicines, especially for trace compounds.

Simultaneous quantitation of water and residual solvents in pharmaceuticals by rapid headspace gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD).	33288344	In the pharmaceutical industry, an array of analytical testing is performed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of drug substance and drug products. Among the most critical attributes of release testing are quantitation of residual solvents from the manufacturing process, which pose toxicity concerns, and determination of water content, which can impact potency and shelf life. Residual solvent determination in pharmaceuticals is most commonly performed using headspace capillary gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID), a robust technique that incorporates a mode of detection noteworthy for its sensitivity and wide dynamic range. However, FID responds exclusively to combustible organic species, and does not produce any signal for common gases such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and notably water. While thermal conductivity detection (TCD) is an alternate, universal mode of detection that has a known response to all GC-appropriate compounds, including water, its use among pharmaceutical companies is uncommon due to the ubiquity of the more sensitive FID and the availability of other techniques for water quantitation such as Karl Fischer titrations (KF). In this work, the use of headspace GC-TCD was successfully demonstrated for the development of a 7.5-minute method for simultaneous quantitation of water, over 25 common residual solvents, and other volatile impurities in small molecule pharmaceutical samples. By carefully controlling sample preparation to minimize the impact of residual water from the diluent, the results for residual solvents and water obtained by this technique were found to be comparable to those of GC-FID and KF, respectively. Headspace GC-TCD improves the throughput of drug testing by greatly reducing the need for KF testing and associated expensive reagents, and helps to conserve samples that are often limited in early stages of development. The technique has desired sensitivity, precision, accuracy and linear dynamic range suitable for pharmaceutical analysis.	TCD	 thermal conductivity detection

Separation based characterization methods for the N-glycosylation analysis of prostate-specific antigen.	33288345	Prostate cancer has the highest malignancy rate diagnosed in men worldwide. Albeit, the gold standard serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assays reduced the mortality rate of the disease, the number of false positive diagnoses steeply increased. Therefore, there is an urgent need for complementary biomarkers to enhance the specificity and selectivity of current diagnostic methods. Information about PSA glycosylation can help to fulfill this gap as alterations of its carbohydrate moieties due to cancerous transformation may represent additional markers to distinguish malignant from benign tumors. However, development of suitable methods and instrumentations to investigate the N-glycosylation profile of PSA represents a challenge. In this paper, we critically review the current bioanalytical trends and strategies in the field of PSA glycobiomarker research focusing on separation based characterization methods.

SWI/SNF-deficient cancers of the Gastroenteropancreatic tract: an in-depth review of the literature and pathology.	33288347	The SWItch Sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex is a large, multi-subunit ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex that acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating transcription. Mutations of SWI/SNF subunits have been described in relation to developmental disorders, hereditary SWI/SNF deficiency syndromes, as well as malignancies. In this review we summarize the current literature in regards to SWI/SNF-deficient tumors of the luminal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and pancreas. As a group they range from moderately to undifferentiated tumors composed of monotonous anaplastic cells, prominent macronucleoli and a variable rhabdoid cell component. Deficiency of a SWI/SNF subunit is typified by complete loss of nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry for respective subunit.	GIT	 gastrointestinal tract
COVID-19 and treating incarcerated populations for opioid use disorder.	33288348	The Franklin County Sheriff's Office (FCSO), in Greenfield, Massachusetts, is among the first jails nationwide to provide correctional populations with access to all three medications to treat. opioid use disorder (MOUD, i.e., buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FCSO quickly implemented comprehensive mitigation policies and adapted MOUD programming. Two major challenges for implementation of the MOUD program were the mandated rapid release of nonviolent pretrial individuals, many of whom were being treated with MOUD and released too quickly to conduct continuity of care planning; and establishing how to deliver physically distanced MOUD services in jail. FCSO implemented and adapted a hub-and-spoke MOUD model, developed telehealth capacity, and experimented with take-home MOUD at release to facilitate continuity-of-care as individuals re-entered the community. Experiences underscore how COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and diffusion of technology-infused OUD treatment and other innovations in criminal justice settings. Looking forward, to address both opioid use disorder and COVID-19, jails and prisons need to develop capacity to implement mitigation strategies, including universal and rapid COVID-19 testing of staff and incarcerated individuals, and be resourced to provide evidence-based addiction treatment. FCSO quickly pivoted and adapted MOUD programming because of its history of applying public health approaches to address the opioid epidemic. Utilizing public health strategies can enable prisons and jails to mitigate the harms of the co-occurring epidemics of OUD and COVID-19, both of which disproportionately affect criminal justice populations, for persons who are incarcerated and the communities to which they return.

Surgical anatomy of the submental artery perforator flap and assessment for application in postoperative reconstruction following oral cancer surgery: a prospective clinical study.	33288358	The submental artery perforator flap (SMAPF) has an elongated pedicle, allowing good cosmetic outcomes to be achieved following oral reconstruction surgery. The improper dissection of perforators often leads to a vascular flap crisis. To avoid this, some surgeons choose to carry amounts of connective tissue around the pedicle. However the inclusion of connective tissue on the pedicle raises concerns about oncological safety. A surgical anatomical study of the submental vessel patterns and subdivisions of the cervical level I lymph nodes was conducted on 33 patients with primary oral cancer who underwent reconstruction with a SMAPF after tumour resection. The variations in vessels and cervical level I lymph nodes observed during SMAPF harvesting were recorded and analyzed. Two patterns of submental artery perforators and three patterns of submental veins were identified. The different characteristics of the lymph node distribution were elucidated for five subdivisions. All SMAPFs survived (n=33, 100%); however, two SMAPFs exhibited partial losses. The 3-year survival rate of patients was 84.5±6.4%, and there were no suspected flap-related recurrences. With detailed anatomical information on the vascular system and lymph node subdivision, SMAPFs are a reliable choice for postoperative reconstruction following oral cancer surgery, meeting the standards for oncological safety.

Islanded facial artery osteomyomucosal/osseous flap in head and neck reconstruction.	33288359	A local pedicled vascularized bone flap can prevent the morbidity and cost of free bone flap surgery in small segmental bone defects or long cartilaginous defects of the head and neck. Such flaps can also be useful in patients who are high risk for surgery. The periosteal vascularity of the mandible can be used to design islanded facial artery-based bone flaps, which can be utilized to that extent. Two patients with a small segmental mandibulectomy defect and one patient with a long cricotracheal resection defect underwent reconstruction using three different designs of islanded facial artery osteomyomucosal/osseous flap (iFOMM). The patients had a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. All flaps were successful, with satisfactory healing and without any functional deficit or disease at last follow-up.	iFOMM	 islanded facial artery osteomyomucosal/osseous flap
Smart needle to diagnose metastatic lymph node using electrical impedance spectroscopy.	33288360	The cause of cervical lymphadenopathy varies from inflammation to malignancy. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is crucial as delayed detection of malignant lymph node can lead to a worse prognosis.

Fatty acid composition, shelf-life and eating quality of beef from steers fed corn or wheat dried distillers' grains with solubles in a concentrate supplement to grass silage.	33288361	Thirty-six steers were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments fed ad libitum grass silage and concentrate supplements containing either barley/soybean meal (CON), 80% DM corn (CDGS)- or 80% DM wheat (WDGS)-dried distillers' grains with solubles for 124 days pre-slaughter. Chemical and fatty acid composition, shelf-life, and eating quality of longissimus thoracis muscle were determined. Dietary CDGS and WDGS increased the proportion of conjugated linoleic acids (P < 0.05) and tended to increase C18:3n-3 (P = 0.075) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.060) relative to the CON. Feeding diets containing distillers' grains reduced the lipid and colour stability of fresh beef patties stored in modified atmosphere packs (MAP), with CDGS exhibiting an intermediate effect between CON and WDGS. Diet did not negatively influence the texture profile parameters and eating quality attributes of beef stored in MAP. The inclusion of CDGS or WDGS in supplementary concentrates may improve the fatty acid profile but decreased the shelf-life of beef.	MAP	 modified atmosphere packs
Healthy beef burgers: Effect of animal fat replacement by algal and wheat germ oil emulsions.	33288362	"The present study aimed to reformulate beef burgers to make them healthier through total replacement of pork backfat by algal (Al) and/or wheat germ (WG) oils emulsions. The addition of oils emulsions increased the protein and decreased the proportions of lipids in the burgers between 26% and 38%. Colour and technological parameters were not affected by the addition of oils, but increased all TPA parameters. α-tocopherol (Vitamin E) increased in reformulated samples. The wheat germ oil reduced the SFA concentration. The use of algal and/or wheat germ oils emulsions increase PUFA concentration. Beef burgers containing algal oil can be claimed as ""high omega-3 content"". Both oils improved the n-6/n-3 and PUFA/SFA nutritional ratios. Sensory differences were observed in the flavour and overall quality parameters. The formulations containing algal oil emulsion were similar to the Control. As a general conclusion, the use of algal oil emulsion as pork backfat substitute improve nutritional characteristics of burger without affecting technological or sensory properties."	Ġn-6/n-3	 algal

Colour and technological parameters were not affected by the addition of oils, but increased all TPA parameters. α-tocopherol (Vitamin E) increased in reformulated samples. The wheat germ oil reduced the SFA concentration. The use of algal and/or wheat germ oils emulsions increase PUFA concentration. Beef burgers containing algal oil can be claimed as ""high omega-3 content"". Both oils improved the n-6/n-3 and PUFA/SFA nutritional ratios. Sensory differences were observed in the flavour and overall quality parameters. The formulations containing algal oil emulsion were similar to the Control. As a general conclusion, the use of algal oil emulsion as pork backfat substitute improve nutritional characteristics of burger without affecting technological or sensory properties."

Consumer liking of M. longissimus lumborum from New Zealand pasture-finished lamb is influenced by intramuscular fat.	33288363	Palatability of meat is known to be affected by intramuscular fat (IMF), but the effect in relatively low-fat New Zealand lamb is unknown. This study evaluated the eating quality of 108 loins (M. longissimus lumborum) from a single flock of ewe-lambs. Loins ranged from 1.09-5.68% IMF and were stratified into 6 groups: 1.65, 2.12, 2.65, 3.20, 3.58 and 4.40%. Consumers' (n = 165) overall liking of lamb increased significantly at around 3% IMF, achieving maximum scores at 4% IMF. One consumer cluster (n = 111) showed a linear increase in overall liking with increasing IMF%, regarded as 'IMF lovers: the more the better', while a second cluster (n = 54) preferred 2.5-3.5% IMF, described as 'IMF optimizers: just the right amount'. IMF% was modestly correlated (~ + 0.25) with all sensory attributes except juiciness. Liking scores were modestly correlated with monounsaturated (~ + 0.25) and polyunsaturated (~ - 0.20) fatty acids. Results suggest aiming for IMF% levels in New Zealand lamb beyond 3% to maximize eating quality for premium markets in particular.	IMF	 intramuscular fat
Case for diagnosis. Erythematous and infiltrated plaques in the infrahyoid region.	33288364	Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and, depending on the host immune status, presents different clinical forms. This report describes the case of a 46-year-old man who had hypoesthetic lesions in the infrahyoid region for 30 days. The bacilloscopy was negative. The anatomopathological examination showed alterations corresponding to the tuberculoid pole (epithelioid histiocytes) and virchowian pole (foamy histiocytes), compatible with borderlinevirchowian leprosy (Ridley and Jopling classification). Rapid tests for HIV I, II, and syphilis were positive, with a CD4 count of 223. The patient started treatment with multibacillary multidrug therapy, antiretroviral therapy, and benzathine penicillin, with marked clinical improvement in two months.	ĠHIV	 classification

Effects of a single dose of psilocybin on behaviour, brain 5-HT2A receptor occupancy and gene expression in the pig.	33288378	Psilocybin has in some studies shown promise as treatment of major depressive disorder and psilocybin therapy was in 2019 twice designated as breakthrough therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A very particular feature is that ingestion of just a single dose of psilocybin is associated with lasting changes in personality and mood. The underlying molecular mechanism behind its effect is, however, unknown. In a translational pig model, we here present the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on pig behaviour, receptor occupancy and gene expression in the brain. An acute i.v. injection of 0.08 mg/kg psilocybin to awake female pigs induced characteristic behavioural changes in terms of headshakes, scratching and rubbing, lasting around 20 min. A similar dose was associated with a cerebral 5-HT2A receptor occupancy of 67%, as determined by positron emission tomography, and plasma psilocin levels were comparable to what in humans is associated with an intense psychedelic experience. We found that 19 genes were differentially expressed in prefrontal cortex one day after psilocybin injection, and 3 genes after 1 week. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that multiple immunological pathways were regulated 1 week after psilocybin exposure. This provides a framework for future investigations of the lasting molecular mechanisms induced by a single dose of psilocybin. In the light of an ongoing debate as to whether psilocybin is a safe treatment for depression and other mental illnesses, it is reassuring that our data suggest that any effects on gene expression are very modest.

Targeting novel inhibitory receptors in cancer immunotherapy.	33288379	T cells play a critical role in promoting tumor regression in both experimental models and humans. Yet, T cells that are chronically exposed to tumor antigen during cancer progression can become dysfunctional/exhausted and fail to induce tumor destruction. Such tumor-induced T cell dysfunction may occur via multiple mechanisms. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitory receptors that are upregulated by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in many cancers limit T cell survival and function. Overcoming this inhibitory receptor-mediated T cell dysfunction has been a central focus of recent developments in cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapies targeting inhibitory receptor pathways such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), alone or in combination, confer significant clinical benefits in multiple tumor types. However, many patients with cancer do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade, and dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade may cause serious adverse events, which limits its indications. Targeting novel non-redundant inhibitory receptor pathways contributing to tumor-induced T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment may prove efficacious and non-toxic. This review presents preclinical and clinical findings supporting the roles of two key pathways-T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT)/CD226/CD96/CD112R-in cancer immunotherapy.	/CD112R-in	96

Unappreciated Roles for K+ Channels in Bacterial Physiology.	33288383	Potassium (K+) channels are highly conserved proteins found in all domains of life, that allow for selective movement of K+ ions across membranes. Despite their broad distribution, the physiological roles of individual members of this diverse channel family have only been thoroughly explored in eukaryotic systems, where they have critical functions in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that bacterial K+ channels have integral roles in electrical signaling, information propagation, and intercellular communication. We discuss how these novel findings impact our understanding of bacterial physiology and the need to continue to explore the native roles of ion channels in microbes.	+)	 Potassium

Flavonoids in Bone Erosive Diseases: Perspectives in Osteoporosis Treatment.	33288387	Imbalance of bone homeostasis, with excessive bone resorption compared with bone formation, leads to the development of progressive osteopenia leading to lower bone resistance to load, with consequent pain and functional limitations. Phytochemicals with therapeutic and preventive effects against bone resorption have recently received increasing attention since they are potentially more suitable for long-term use than traditional therapeutic chemical compounds. In this systematic review of the literature of the past 5 years, comprehensive information is provided on flavonoids with potential antiresorption and pro-osteogenic effects. It aims to highlight the molecular mechanisms of these molecules, often epigenetic, and their possible pharmacological use, which is of great importance for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis (OP).

The aetiopathogenesis of SLE is complex. Young women and certain ethnicities are commonly affected, suggesting a significant hormonal and genetic influence. Diverse immunological abnormalities have been described. A characteristic abnormality is the presence of autoantibodies, implicating a central role for B cells in disease pathogenesis and/or perpetuation. Whilst conventional therapies have improved outcomes, a great unmet need remains. Recently, biological therapies are being explored. B-cell depletion therapy with rituximab has been in use off-label for nearly two decades. Inconsistent results between uncontrolled and controlled studies have raised doubts about its efficacy. In this review, we will focus on B cell abnormalities and the rationale behind B-cell depletion therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), rituximab, will be explored including an evaluation of clinical and trial experience. Finally, we will discuss the mechanistic basis for considering alternative anti-CD20 mAbs.	mAb	 monoclonal antibody

Cost analysis and optimization of Blockchain-based solid waste management traceability system.	33288397	As global concerns over End-of-Life (EoL) wastes released to the environment is rising, the need for enhancing the transparency of recycling systems is growing. To address the waste traceability issue, technologies such as Blockchain can be instrumental in the proper disposal and handling of wastes. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based Solid Waste Management (SWM) model that can help municipalities enhance the efficiency of their waste management efforts. A Blockchain framework owned and controlled by a municipality is proposed in which customer companies pay to join the platform to avail services from the suppliers managed by the municipality. The cost burdens to both supplier and consumer companies have been discussed. In addition, an optimization model is developed to determine the optimal quantity of waste that can be traded between supplier and consumer companies in order to maximize their profit based on parameters such as the number of suppliers, consumer companies, and the processing capacity of customer companies and several constraints including maximum storing capacity, storage, and transportation constraints. Further, the cost aspects associated with Blockchain implementation are estimated from several use cases obtained from companies providing Blockchain solutions.	SWM	 Solid Waste Management
Comparison of three analytical techniques for determination of Th and U in environmental samples.	33288398	Alpha-particle spectrometry, gamma spectrometry and neutron activation analysis techniques for determination of Th and U in environmental samples have been compared.

The results show that neutron activation analysis technique has the best accuracy among the studied techniques; the other two techniques were assessed relative to it. The percentage difference between the three techniques results is about [-20, 20]. In addition, U and Th concentrations are generally overestimated by gamma spectrometry and alpha-particle spectrometry in all cases except Th concentration in the former technique, which is underestimated.

New Markers of Bone Fragility in Hemodialysis Patients: A Monocentric Study.	33288423	Mechanisms underlying bone fragility in patients under dialysis are various. The assessment of bone disorder is not yet codified in these patients. Our study aimed to determine the relationship between the serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) level and bone fragility. We also aimed to assess the bone alkaline phosphatase (bAP) to the C-terminal telopeptide of type I (CTX) ratio and the FGF23*bAP product to CTX ratio in patients under hemodialysis.	bAP	 bone alkaline phosphatase

Impedimetric aptamer-based glycan PSA score for discrimination of prostate cancer from other prostate diseases.	33288424	Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the common biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa). However, its lack of specificity to differentiate PCa from benign prostate disorders stimulates the search for alternative cancer biomarkers to improve the clinical management of the patients. Different studies have described changes in the core-fucosylation level of PSA between PCa patients and healthy controls. To exploit these findings, we have adapted an impedimetric aptamer-based sensor to the dual recognition of PSA. Two different aptamers, PSAG-1 and anti-PSA, are immobilized onto two adjacent nanostructured gold electrodes. The direct binding from diluted serum samples of specific glycosylated-PSA to the first sensor and total PSA to the second one leads to changes in the charge transfer resistance, which correlate to the amount of glycosylated and total PSA in the sample. The sensors are able to measure PSA in serum with a dynamic range between 0.26 and 62.5 ng/mL (PSAG-1) and from 0.64 to 62.5 ng/mL (anti-PSA), with a reproducibility of 5.4 %. The final output of the proposed platform is the ratio between PSAG-1 reactive PSA and total PSA, defined as the glycan score. The glycan score was tested in serum samples from patients with different pathologies, showing excellent correlation between the measured score and the known diagnosis of the patients. Hence this dual aptamer-based impedimetric biosensor could be used as a minimally invasive method for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.	PCa	 prostate cancer

Epitope imprinting of alpha-synuclein for sensing in Parkinson's brain organoid culture medium.	33288425	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, whose early signs may be mild and unnoticed. α-Synuclein has been identified as the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are the characteristic proteinaceous deposits that are the hallmarks of PD. In this work, three alpha-synuclein peptides were synthesized as templates for the molecular imprinting of conductive polymers to enable recognition of alpha-synuclein via ultrasensitive electrochemical measurements. The peptide sequences encompassed specific residues where mutations are known to accelerate PD (though the target sequences, in this study, were wild-type.) The different peptide targets were all successfully imprinted, but with differing imprinting effectiveness, probably owing to differences in target carboxylic acids (which can bind to the aniline (AN) m-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (MSAN) MIP polymers.) Composition of the imprinted polymer, (the mole proportions of AN and MSAN), and the concentrations and sequences of imprinted peptide templates were optimized by measuring the electrochemical responses to target peptides. The imprinted electrode can detect alpha-synuclein at fg/mL levels, and was therefore used to measure alpha-synuclein in the culture medium of human brain organoids generated from normal and idiopathic PD patients.

An amperometric biosensor of L-fucose in urine for the first screening test of cancer.	33288426	Quantitative routine detection of fucose, which is a cancer marker, in urine is effective for the preliminary screening of cancer. Amperometric biosensing methods have the advantage of being simple, rapid, and precise for urinalysis. However, coexisting electroactive interferences such as ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA) prevent accurate measurements. In this work, an amperometric l-fucose biosensor unaffected by interferences was developed and utilizes direct electron transfer type bioelectrocatalysis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent pyranose dehydrogenase from Coprinopsis cinerea (CcPDH). The isolated PQQ domain from CcPDH was immobilized on gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-modified electrodes, which obtained a catalytic current at a lower potential than the oxidation potential of the interfering compounds. Applying an operating potential of -0.1 V vs. Ag|AgCl (3 M NaCl) enabled the detection of l-fucose while completely eliminating the oxidation of AA, DA, and UA on the electrodes. The increase in the specific area of the electrodes by increasing the AuNP drop-casting time resulted in an improvement in the sensor performance. The biosensor exhibited a linear range for l-fucose detection between 0.1 mM and 1 mM (R2 = 0.9996), including a cut-off value, the sensitivity was 3.12 ± 0.05 μA mM-1 cm-2, and the detection limit was 13.6 μM at a signal-to-noise ratio of three. The biosensor can be used to quantify the concentration of l-fucose at physiological levels and does not require urine preprocessing, making it applicable to practical use for point-of-care testing with urine.

Real-time nanoplasmonic sensing of three-dimensional morphological changes in a supported lipid bilayer and antimicrobial testing applications.	33288427	We report the development of a real-time localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensing strategy to detect three-dimensional morphological changes in a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) on a plasmonic substrate. The sensing concept advances on past efforts to detect subtle conformational changes in adsorbed biomacromolecules by demonstrating the capability to track large-scale, complex adsorbate shape changes and to classify different types of shape changes based on specific, multi-step measurement signatures. To validate this concept, we tested the addition of antimicrobial fatty acids, monoglycerides, and surfactants in micellar form to the SLB platform, which triggered specific three-dimensional membrane morphological changes such as tubule or bud formation along with solubilization. Experimentally, the different remodeling events were detected by distinct measurement signatures related to the shape and size of lipid protrusions that formed and evolved over time, which agreed well with a newly developed theoretical model. Our conceptual approach and formalism are applicable to various biosensing techniques, including not only LSPR but also surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. These sensing capabilities are advantageous for evaluating the mechanisms of antimicrobial drug candidates and other membrane-active compounds, and the measurement strategy is extendable to a wide range of biomimetic lipid compositions.

Unidirectional intercellular communication on a microfluidic chip.	33288428	Cell co-culture serves as a standard method to study intercellular communication. However, random diffusion of signal molecules during co-culture may arouse crosstalk among different types of cells and hide directive signal-target responses. Here, a microfluidic chip is proposed to study unidirectional intercellular communication by spatially controlling the flow of the signal molecules. The chip contains two separated chambers connected by two channels where the culture media flows oppositely. A zigzag signal-blocking channel is designed to study the function of a specific signal. The chip is applied to study the unidirectional communication between tumor cells and stromal cells. It shows that the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (a marker of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)) of both MRC-5 fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells can be up-regulated only by the secreta from invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, but not from non-invasive MCF-7 cells. The proliferation of the tumor cells can be improved by the stromal cells. Moreover, transforming growth factor beta 1 is found as one of the main factors for CAF transformation via the signal-blocking function. The chip achieves unidirectional cell communication along X-axis, signal concentration gradient along Y-axis and 3D cell culture along Z-axis, which provides a useful tool for cell communication studies.

Morphological analysis of chromium in carbon quantum dots pairs Co-doped with zirconium and nitrogen and their applications in imaging of living cells.	33288432	As a new nanomaterial in the biochemistry field, carbon quantum dots (CDs) have been widely applied by scientists. In this study, CDs co-doped with zirconium and nitrogen (Zr-N-CDs) were synthesized quickly with lemon, ethylenediamine, and zirconium chloride through a hydrothermal method. The yield of Zr-N-CDs reached as high as 82.7%. The Zr-N-CDs showed outstanding water solubility in aqueous solution. The formation of Zr-N-CDs was verified by characterization technologies, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, the optical properties of Zr-N-CDs were investigated through fluorophotometer and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The synthesized Zr-N-CDs were applied to test hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)), which showed a good linear relationship with the fluorescence quenching of Zr-N-CDs. The limit of detection was 0.52 µM. An analytical method for Cr morphology in natural water areas was developed in this experiment. The sensor showed good stability. The results demonstrate that the sensor detected 98.35%-100.9% Cr (VI) recovery rate in water samples. Based on the cytotoxicity of Zr-N-CDs to human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells), the Zr-N-CDs had no evident cytotoxicity.

Morphological analysis of chromium in carbon quantum dots pairs Co-doped with zirconium and nitrogen and their applications in imaging of living cells.	33288432	As a new nanomaterial in the biochemistry field, carbon quantum dots (CDs) have been widely applied by scientists. In this study, CDs co-doped with zirconium and nitrogen (Zr-N-CDs) were synthesized quickly with lemon, ethylenediamine, and zirconium chloride through a hydrothermal method. The yield of Zr-N-CDs reached as high as 82.7%. The Zr-N-CDs showed outstanding water solubility in aqueous solution. The formation of Zr-N-CDs was verified by characterization technologies, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, the optical properties of Zr-N-CDs were investigated through fluorophotometer and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The synthesized Zr-N-CDs were applied to test hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)), which showed a good linear relationship with the fluorescence quenching of Zr-N-CDs. The limit of detection was 0.52 µM. An analytical method for Cr morphology in natural water areas was developed in this experiment. The sensor showed good stability. The results demonstrate that the sensor detected 98.35%-100.9% Cr (VI) recovery rate in water samples. Based on the cytotoxicity of Zr-N-CDs to human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells), the Zr-N-CDs had no evident cytotoxicity. The applications of Zr-N-CDs in bioimaging of cells were determined through laser scanning confocal microscopy.	CDs	 carbon quantum dots

Multi-faceted regulation of IgE production and humoral memory formation.	33288436	IgE antibodies play a protective role against parasites and environmental toxins by its strong effector functions. However, aberrant IgE production can contribute to the development of allergic disorders, and thus is tightly regulated. Beside its very short half-life, IgE is normally produced only transiently and its affinity maturation is limited under physiological immune responses. Although such distinct characteristics of IgE among Ig classes are well-known, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been understood until recently. Somatic or genetic defects of such mechanisms can lead to pathogenesis of allergic diseases. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that control the production of IgE and formation of IgE-type humoral memory, focusing on the B cell immune responses.

MET Amplification (MET/CEP7 Ratio ≥ 1.8) Is an Independent Poor Prognostic Marker in Patients With Treatment-naive Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer.	33288441	The MET pathway is a promising target in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis has become a standard method to detect MET amplification. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the definition of MET amplification. We aimed to find clinically meaningful cutoffs for MET amplification that could be used as a prognostic marker and/or indication for MET inhibitor therapy.	NSCLC	 non-small-cell lung cancer
